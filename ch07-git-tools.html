  <h1>Git Tools</h1>
  <p >By now, you&#8217;ve learned most of the day-to-day commands and workflows that you need to manage or maintain a Git repository for your source code control.
You&#8217;ve accomplished the basic tasks of tracking and committing files, and you&#8217;ve harnessed the power of the staging area and lightweight topic branching and merging.</p>

<p >Now you&#8217;ll explore a number of very powerful things that Git can do that you may not necessarily use on a day-to-day basis but that you may need at some point.</p>

<section class="section" id="_revision_selection">
  <h2>Revision Selection</h2>
  <p >Git allows you to refer to a single commit, set of commits, or range of commits in a number of ways.
They aren&#8217;t necessarily obvious but are helpful to know.</p>

<section class="section" id="_single_revisions">
  <h3>Single Revisions</h3>
  <p >You can obviously refer to any single commit by its full, 40-character SHA-1 hash, but there are more human-friendly ways to refer to commits as well.
This section outlines the various ways you can refer to any commit.</p>

</section>

<section class="section" id="_short_sha_1">
  <h3>Short SHA-1</h3>
  <p >Git is smart enough to figure out what commit you&#8217;re referring to if you provide the first few characters of the SHA-1 hash, as long as that partial hash is at least four characters long and unambiguous; that is, no other object in the object database can have a hash that begins with the same prefix.</p>

<p >For example, to examine a specific commit where you know you added certain functionality, you might first run the <code>git log</code> command to locate the commit:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git log
commit 734713bc047d87bf7eac9674765ae793478c50d3

    fixed refs handling, added gc auto, updated tests

commit d921970aadf03b3cf0e71becdaab3147ba71cdef
Merge: 1c002dd... 35cfb2b...

Date:   Thu Dec 11 14:58:32 2008 -0800

    added some blame and merge stuff</pre>
</figure>

<p >In this case, say you&#8217;re interested in the commit whose hash begins with <code>1c002dd&#8230;&#8203;</code>.
You can inspect that commit with any of the following variations of <code>git show</code> (assuming the shorter versions are unambiguous):</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git show 1c002dd4b536e7479fe34593e72e6c6c1819e53b
$ git show 1c002dd4b536e7479f
$ git show 1c002d</pre>
</figure>

<p >Git can figure out a short, unique abbreviation for your SHA-1 values.
If you pass <code>--abbrev-commit</code> to the <code>git log</code> command, the output will use shorter values but keep them unique; it defaults to using seven characters but makes them longer if necessary to keep the SHA-1 unambiguous:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git log --abbrev-commit --pretty=oneline
ca82a6d changed the version number
085bb3b removed unnecessary test code
a11bef0 first commit</pre>
</figure>

<p >Generally, eight to ten characters are more than enough to be unique within a project.
For example, as of February 2019, the Linux kernel (which is a fairly sizable project) has over 875,000 commits and almost seven million objects in its object database, with no two objects whose SHA-1s are identical in the first 12 characters.</p>

<div class="admonition admonition-note" >

  </div>
  <div class="admonition-content">
    <h5>A SHORT NOTE ABOUT SHA-1</h5>
    <p >A lot of people become concerned at some point that they will, by random happenstance, have two distinct objects in their repository that hash to the same SHA-1 value.
What then?</p>

<p >If you do happen to commit an object that hashes to the same SHA-1 value as a previous <em>different</em> object in your repository, Git will see the previous object already in your Git database, assume it was already written and simply reuse it.
If you try to check out that object again at some point, you&#8217;ll always get the data of the first object.</p>

<p >However, you should be aware of how ridiculously unlikely this scenario is.
The SHA-1 digest is 20 bytes or 160 bits.
The number of randomly hashed objects needed to ensure a 50% probability of a single collision is about 2<sup>80</sup>
(the formula for determining collision probability is <code>p = (n(n-1)/2) * (1/2^160))</code>. 2<sup>80</sup>
is 1.2 x 10<sup>24</sup>
or 1 million billion billion.
That&#8217;s 1,200 times the number of grains of sand on the earth.</p>

<p >Here&#8217;s an example to give you an idea of what it would take to get a SHA-1 collision.
If all 6.5 billion humans on Earth were programming, and every second, each one was producing code that was the equivalent of the entire Linux kernel history (6.5 million Git objects) and pushing it into one enormous Git repository, it would take roughly 2 years until that repository contained enough objects to have a 50% probability of a single SHA-1 object collision.
Thus, a SHA-1 collision is less likely than every member of your programming team being attacked and killed by wolves in unrelated incidents on the same night.</p>

<section class="section" id="_branch_references">
  <h3>Branch References</h3>
  <p >One straightforward way to refer to a particular commit is if it&#8217;s the commit at the tip of a branch; in that case, you can simply use the branch name in any Git command that expects a reference to a commit.
For instance, if you want to examine the last commit object on a branch, the following commands are equivalent, assuming that the <code>topic1</code> branch points to commit <code>ca82a6d&#8230;&#8203;</code>:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git show ca82a6dff817ec66f44342007202690a93763949
$ git show topic1</pre>
</figure>

<p >If you want to see which specific SHA-1 a branch points to, or if you want to see what any of these examples boils down to in terms of SHA-1s, you can use a Git plumbing tool called <code>rev-parse</code>.
You can see <a class="xref" href="ch10-git-internals.html">Git Internals</a> for more information about plumbing tools; basically, <code>rev-parse</code> exists for lower-level operations and isn&#8217;t designed to be used in day-to-day operations.
However, it can be helpful sometimes when you need to see what&#8217;s really going on.
Here you can run <code>rev-parse</code> on your branch.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git rev-parse topic1
ca82a6dff817ec66f44342007202690a93763949</pre>
</figure>

</section>

<section class="section" id="_git_reflog">
  <h3>RefLog Shortnames</h3>
  <p >One of the things Git does in the background while you&#8217;re working away is keep a ``reflog''&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;a log of where your HEAD and branch references have been for the last few months.</p>

<p >You can see your reflog by using <code>git reflog</code>:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git reflog
734713b HEAD@{0}: commit: fixed refs handling, added gc auto, updated
d921970 HEAD@{1}: merge phedders/rdocs: Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
1c002dd HEAD@{2}: commit: added some blame and merge stuff
1c36188 HEAD@{3}: rebase -i (squash): updating HEAD
95df984 HEAD@{4}: commit: # This is a combination of two commits.
1c36188 HEAD@{5}: rebase -i (squash): updating HEAD
7e05da5 HEAD@{6}: rebase -i (pick): updating HEAD</pre>
</figure>

<p >Every time your branch tip is updated for any reason, Git stores that information for you in this temporary history.
You can use your reflog data to refer to older commits as well.
For example, if you want to see the fifth prior value of the HEAD of your repository, you can use the <code>@{5}</code> reference that you see in the reflog output:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git show HEAD@{5}</pre>
</figure>

<p >You can also use this syntax to see where a branch was some specific amount of time ago.
For instance, to see where your <code>master</code> branch was yesterday, you can type</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git show master@{yesterday}</pre>
</figure>

<p >That would show you where tip of your <code>master</code> branch was yesterday.
This technique only works for data that&#8217;s still in your reflog, so you can&#8217;t use it to look for commits older than a few months.</p>

<p >To see reflog information formatted like the <code>git log</code> output, you can run <code>git log -g</code>:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git log -g master

</figure>

<p >It&#8217;s important to note that reflog information is strictly local&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;it&#8217;s a log only of what <em>you&#8217;ve</em> done in <em>your</em> repository.
The references won&#8217;t be the same on someone else&#8217;s copy of the repository; also, right after you initially clone a repository, you&#8217;ll have an empty reflog, as no activity has occurred yet in your repository.
Running <code>git show HEAD@{2.months.ago}</code> will show you the matching commit only if you cloned the project at least two months ago&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;if you cloned it any more recently than that, you&#8217;ll see only your first local commit.</p>

    <h5>Think of the reflog as Git&#8217;s version of shell history</h5>
    <p >If you have a UNIX or Linux background, you can think of the reflog as Git&#8217;s version of shell history, which emphasizes that what&#8217;s there is clearly relevant only for you and your ``session'', and has nothing to do with anyone else who might be working on the same machine.</p>

  </div>

</section>

<section class="section" id="_ancestry_references">
  <h3>Ancestry References</h3>
  <p >The other main way to specify a commit is via its ancestry.
If you place a <code>^</code> (caret) at the end of a reference, Git resolves it to mean the parent of that commit.
Suppose you look at the history of your project:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git log --pretty=format:'%h %s' --graph
* 734713b fixed refs handling, added gc auto, updated tests
*   d921970 Merge commit 'phedders/rdocs'
|\
| * 35cfb2b Some rdoc changes
* | 1c002dd added some blame and merge stuff
|/
* 1c36188 ignore *.gem
* 9b29157 add open3_detach to gemspec file list</pre>
</figure>

<p >Then, you can see the previous commit by specifying <code>HEAD^</code>, which means ``the parent of HEAD'':</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git show HEAD^
commit d921970aadf03b3cf0e71becdaab3147ba71cdef
Merge: 1c002dd... 35cfb2b...

Date:   Thu Dec 11 15:08:43 2008 -0800

    Merge commit 'phedders/rdocs'</pre>
</figure>

<div class="admonition admonition-note" >
  <div class="admonition-icon">
  </div>
  <div class="admonition-content">
    <h5>Escaping the caret on Windows</h5>
    <p >On Windows in <code>cmd.exe</code>, <code>^</code> is a special character and needs to be treated differently.
You can either double it or put the commit reference in quotes:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git show HEAD^     # will NOT work on Windows
$ git show HEAD^^    # OK
$ git show "HEAD^"   # OK</pre>
</figure>

  </div>
</div>

<p >You can also specify a number after the <code>^</code> to identify <em>which</em> parent you want; for example, <code>d921970^2</code> means <code>`the second parent of d921970.''
This syntax is useful only for merge commits, which have more than one parent&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the <em>first</em> parent of a merge commit is from the branch you were on when you merged (frequently `master</code>), while the <em>second</em> parent of a merge commit is from the branch that was merged (say, <code>topic</code>):</p>

<p >The other main ancestry specification is the <code>~</code> (tilde).
This also refers to the first parent, so <code>HEAD~</code> and <code>HEAD^</code> are equivalent.
The difference becomes apparent when you specify a number.
<code>HEAD~2</code> means <code>the first parent of the first parent,'' or </code>the grandparent''&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;it traverses the first parents the number of times you specify.
For example, in the history listed earlier, <code>HEAD~3</code> would be</p>

<p >This can also be written <code>HEAD<sub>~</sub></code>, which again is the first parent of the first parent of the first parent:</p>

    ignore *.gem</pre>
</figure>

<p >You can also combine these syntaxes&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;you can get the second parent of the previous reference (assuming it was a merge commit) by using <code>HEAD~3^2</code>, and so on.</p>

<section class="section" id="_commit_ranges">
  <h3>Commit Ranges</h3>
  <p >Now that you can specify individual commits, let&#8217;s see how to specify ranges of commits.
This is particularly useful for managing your branches&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;if you have a lot of branches, you can use range specifications to answer questions such as, ``What work is on this branch that I haven&#8217;t yet merged into my main branch?''</p>

<section class="section" id="_double_dot">
  <h4>Double Dot</h4>
  <p >The most common range specification is the double-dot syntax.
This basically asks Git to resolve a range of commits that are reachable from one commit but aren&#8217;t reachable from another.
For example, say you have a commit history that looks like <a class="xref" href="ch07-git-tools.html#double_dot">Example history for range selection.</a>.</p>

<figure class="image" id="double_dot">
  
    <img src="images/double-dot.png"
         alt="Example history for range selection."
         
          />
  
  
    <figcaption>Figure 137. Example history for range selection.</figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p >Say you want to see what is in your <code>experiment</code> branch that hasn&#8217;t yet been merged into your <code>master</code> branch.
You can ask Git to show you a log of just those commits with <code>master..experiment</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;that means <code>`all commits reachable from `experiment</code> that aren&#8217;t reachable from <code>master</code>.''
For the sake of brevity and clarity in these examples, the letters of the commit objects from the diagram are used in place of the actual log output in the order that they would display:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git log master..experiment
D
C</pre>
</figure>

<p >If, on the other hand, you want to see the opposite&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;all commits in <code>master</code> that aren&#8217;t in <code>experiment</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;you can reverse the branch names.
<code>experiment..master</code> shows you everything in <code>master</code> not reachable from <code>experiment</code>:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git log experiment..master
F
E</pre>
</figure>

<p >This is useful if you want to keep the <code>experiment</code> branch up to date and preview what you&#8217;re about to merge.
Another frequent use of this syntax is to see what you&#8217;re about to push to a remote:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git log origin/master..HEAD</pre>
</figure>

<p >This command shows you any commits in your current branch that aren&#8217;t in the <code>master</code> branch on your <code>origin</code> remote.
If you run a <code>git push</code> and your current branch is tracking <code>origin/master</code>, the commits listed by <code>git log origin/master..HEAD</code> are the commits that will be transferred to the server.
You can also leave off one side of the syntax to have Git assume <code>HEAD</code>.
For example, you can get the same results as in the previous example by typing <code>git log origin/master..</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Git substitutes <code>HEAD</code> if one side is missing.</p>

</section>

<section class="section" id="_multiple_points">
  <h4>Multiple Points</h4>
  <p >The double-dot syntax is useful as a shorthand, but perhaps you want to specify more than two branches to indicate your revision, such as seeing what commits are in any of several branches that aren&#8217;t in the branch you&#8217;re currently on.
Git allows you to do this by using either the <code>^</code> character or <code>--not</code> before any reference from which you don&#8217;t want to see reachable commits.
Thus, the following three commands are equivalent:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git log refA..refB
$ git log ^refA refB
$ git log refB --not refA</pre>
</figure>

<p >This is nice because with this syntax you can specify more than two references in your query, which you cannot do with the double-dot syntax.
For instance, if you want to see all commits that are reachable from <code>refA</code> or <code>refB</code> but not from <code>refC</code>, you can use either of:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git log refA refB ^refC
$ git log refA refB --not refC</pre>
</figure>

<p >This makes for a very powerful revision query system that should help you figure out what is in your branches.</p>

</section>

<section class="section" id="_triple_dot">
  <h4>Triple Dot</h4>
  <p >The last major range-selection syntax is the triple-dot syntax, which specifies all the commits that are reachable by <em>either</em> of two references but not by both of them.
Look back at the example commit history in <a class="xref" href="ch07-git-tools.html#double_dot">Example history for range selection.</a>.
If you want to see what is in <code>master</code> or <code>experiment</code> but not any common references, you can run:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git log master...experiment
F
E
D
C</pre>
</figure>

<p >Again, this gives you normal <code>log</code> output but shows you only the commit information for those four commits, appearing in the traditional commit date ordering.</p>

<p >A common switch to use with the <code>log</code> command in this case is <code>--left-right</code>, which shows you which side of the range each commit is in.
This helps make the output more useful:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git log --left-right master...experiment
&lt; F
&lt; E
&gt; D
&gt; C</pre>
</figure>

<p >With these tools, you can much more easily let Git know what commit or commits you want to inspect.</p>

</section>

</section>

</section>

<section class="section" id="_interactive_staging">
  <h2>Interactive Staging</h2>
  <p >In this section, you&#8217;ll look at a few interactive Git commands that can help you craft your commits to include only certain combinations and parts of files.
These tools are helpful if you modify a number of files extensively, then decide that you want those changes to be partitioned into several focused commits rather than one big messy commit.
This way, you can make sure your commits are logically separate changesets and can be reviewed easily by the developers working with you.</p>

<p >If you run <code>git add</code> with the <code>-i</code> or <code>--interactive</code> option, Git enters an interactive shell mode, displaying something like this:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git add -i
           staged     unstaged path
  1:    unchanged        +0/-1 TODO
  2:    unchanged        +1/-1 index.html
  3:    unchanged        +5/-1 lib/simplegit.rb

*** Commands ***
  1: [s]tatus     2: [u]pdate      3: [r]evert     4: [a]dd untracked
  5: [p]atch      6: [d]iff        7: [q]uit       8: [h]elp
What now&gt;</pre>
</figure>

<p >You can see that this command shows you a much different view of your staging area than you&#8217;re probably used to&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;basically, the same information you get with <code>git status</code> but a bit more succinct and informative.
It lists the changes you&#8217;ve staged on the left and unstaged changes on the right.</p>

<p >After this comes a ``Commands'' section, which allows you to do a number of things like staging and unstaging files, staging parts of files, adding untracked files, and displaying diffs of what has been staged.</p>

<section class="section" id="_staging_and_unstaging_files">
  <h3>Staging and Unstaging Files</h3>
  <p >If you type <code>u</code> or <code>2</code> (for update) at the <code>What now&gt;</code> prompt, you&#8217;re prompted for which files you want to stage:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>What now&gt; u
           staged     unstaged path
  1:    unchanged        +0/-1 TODO
  2:    unchanged        +1/-1 index.html
  3:    unchanged        +5/-1 lib/simplegit.rb
Update&gt;&gt;</pre>
</figure>

<p >To stage the <code>TODO</code> and <code>index.html</code> files, you can type the numbers:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>Update&gt;&gt; 1,2
           staged     unstaged path
* 1:    unchanged        +0/-1 TODO
* 2:    unchanged        +1/-1 index.html
  3:    unchanged        +5/-1 lib/simplegit.rb
Update&gt;&gt;</pre>
</figure>

<p >The <code>*</code> next to each file means the file is selected to be staged.
If you press Enter after typing nothing at the <code>Update&gt;&gt;</code> prompt, Git takes anything selected and stages it for you:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>Update&gt;&gt;
updated 2 paths

*** Commands ***
  1: [s]tatus     2: [u]pdate      3: [r]evert     4: [a]dd untracked
  5: [p]atch      6: [d]iff        7: [q]uit       8: [h]elp

  2:        +1/-1      nothing index.html
  3:    unchanged        +5/-1 lib/simplegit.rb</pre>
</figure>

<p >Now you can see that the <code>TODO</code> and <code>index.html</code> files are staged and the <code>simplegit.rb</code> file is still unstaged.
If you want to unstage the <code>TODO</code> file at this point, you use the <code>r</code> or <code>3</code> (for revert) option:</p>

</figure>

<p >Looking at your Git status again, you can see that you&#8217;ve unstaged the <code>TODO</code> file:</p>

<figure class="listing" >

  3:    unchanged        +5/-1 lib/simplegit.rb</pre>
</figure>

<p >To see the diff of what you&#8217;ve staged, you can use the <code>d</code> or <code>6</code> (for diff) command.
It shows you a list of your staged files, and you can select the ones for which you would like to see the staged diff.
This is much like specifying <code>git diff --cached</code> on the command line:</p>

<section class="section" id="_staging_patches">
  <h3>Staging Patches</h3>
  <p >It&#8217;s also possible for Git to stage certain <em>parts</em> of files and not the rest.
For example, if you make two changes to your <code>simplegit.rb</code> file and want to stage one of them and not the other, doing so is very easy in Git.
From the same interactive prompt explained in the previous section, type <code>p</code> or <code>5</code> (for patch).
Git will ask you which files you would like to partially stage; then, for each section of the selected files, it will display hunks of the file diff and ask if you would like to stage them, one by one:</p>

Stage this hunk [y,n,a,d,/,j,J,g,e,?]?</pre>

<p >You have a lot of options at this point.
Typing <code>?</code> shows a list of what you can do:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>Stage this hunk [y,n,a,d,/,j,J,g,e,?]? ?
y - stage this hunk
n - do not stage this hunk
a - stage this and all the remaining hunks in the file
d - do not stage this hunk nor any of the remaining hunks in the file
g - select a hunk to go to
/ - search for a hunk matching the given regex
j - leave this hunk undecided, see next undecided hunk
J - leave this hunk undecided, see next hunk
k - leave this hunk undecided, see previous undecided hunk
K - leave this hunk undecided, see previous hunk
s - split the current hunk into smaller hunks
e - manually edit the current hunk
? - print help</pre>
</figure>

<p >Generally, you&#8217;ll type <code>y</code> or <code>n</code> if you want to stage each hunk, but staging all of them in certain files or skipping a hunk decision until later can be helpful too.
If you stage one part of the file and leave another part unstaged, your status output will look like this:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>What now&gt; 1
           staged     unstaged path

<p >The status of the <code>simplegit.rb</code> file is interesting.
It shows you that a couple of lines are staged and a couple are unstaged.
You&#8217;ve partially staged this file.
At this point, you can exit the interactive adding script and run <code>git commit</code> to commit the partially staged files.</p>

<p >You also don&#8217;t need to be in interactive add mode to do the partial-file staging&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;you can start the same script by using <code>git add -p</code> or <code>git add --patch</code> on the command line.</p>

<p >Furthermore, you can use patch mode for partially resetting files with the <code>git reset --patch</code> command, for checking out parts of files with the <code>git checkout --patch</code> command and for stashing parts of files with the <code>git stash save --patch</code> command.
We&#8217;ll go into more details on each of these as we get to more advanced usages of these commands.</p>

<section class="section" id="_git_stashing">
  <h2>Stashing and Cleaning</h2>
  <p >Often, when you&#8217;ve been working on part of your project, things are in a messy state and you want to switch branches for a bit to work on something else.
The problem is, you don&#8217;t want to do a commit of half-done work just so you can get back to this point later.
The answer to this issue is the <code>git stash</code> command.</p>

<p >Stashing takes the dirty state of your working directory&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;that is, your modified tracked files and staged changes&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and saves it on a stack of unfinished changes that you can reapply at any time (even on a different branch).</p>

    <h5>Migrating to <code>git stash push</code></h5>
    <p >As of late October 2017, there has been extensive discussion on the Git mailing list, wherein the command <code>git stash save</code> is being deprecated in favour of the existing alternative <code>git stash push</code>.
The main reason for this is that <code>git stash push</code> introduces the option of stashing selected <em>pathspecs</em>, something <code>git stash save</code> does not support.</p>

<p ><code>git stash save</code> is not going away any time soon, so don&#8217;t worry about it suddenly disappearing.
But you might want to start migrating over to the <code>push</code> alternative for the new functionality.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<section class="section" id="_stashing_your_work">
  <h3>Stashing Your Work</h3>
  <p >To demonstrate stashing, you&#8217;ll go into your project and start working on a couple of files and possibly stage one of the changes.
If you run <code>git status</code>, you can see your dirty state:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git status
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

	modified:   index.html

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   lib/simplegit.rb</pre>
</figure>

<p >Now you want to switch branches, but you don&#8217;t want to commit what you&#8217;ve been working on yet, so you&#8217;ll stash the changes.
To push a new stash onto your stack, run <code>git stash</code> or <code>git stash push</code>:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git stash
Saved working directory and index state \
  "WIP on master: 049d078 added the index file"
HEAD is now at 049d078 added the index file
(To restore them type "git stash apply")</pre>
</figure>

<p >You can now see that your working directory is clean:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git status
# On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean</pre>
</figure>

<p >At this point, you can switch branches and do work elsewhere; your changes are stored on your stack.
To see which stashes you&#8217;ve stored, you can use <code>git stash list</code>:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git stash list
stash@{0}: WIP on master: 049d078 added the index file
stash@{1}: WIP on master: c264051 Revert "added file_size"
stash@{2}: WIP on master: 21d80a5 added number to log</pre>
</figure>

<p >In this case, two stashes were saved previously, so you have access to three different stashed works.
You can reapply the one you just stashed by using the command shown in the help output of the original stash command: <code>git stash apply</code>.
If you want to apply one of the older stashes, you can specify it by naming it, like this: <code>git stash apply stash@{2}</code>.
If you don&#8217;t specify a stash, Git assumes the most recent stash and tries to apply it:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git stash apply
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   index.html
	modified:   lib/simplegit.rb

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")</pre>
</figure>

<p >You can see that Git re-modifies the files you reverted when you saved the stash.
In this case, you had a clean working directory when you tried to apply the stash, and you tried to apply it on the same branch you saved it from.
Having a clean working directory and applying it on the same branch aren&#8217;t necessary to successfully apply a stash.
You can save a stash on one branch, switch to another branch later, and try to reapply the changes.
You can also have modified and uncommitted files in your working directory when you apply a stash&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Git gives you merge conflicts if anything no longer applies cleanly.</p>

<p >The changes to your files were reapplied, but the file you staged before wasn&#8217;t restaged.
To do that, you must run the <code>git stash apply</code> command with a <code>--index</code> option to tell the command to try to reapply the staged changes.
If you had run that instead, you&#8217;d have gotten back to your original position:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git stash apply --index
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

	modified:   index.html

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   lib/simplegit.rb</pre>
</figure>

<p >The apply option only tries to apply the stashed work&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;you continue to have it on your stack.
To remove it, you can run <code>git stash drop</code> with the name of the stash to remove:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git stash list
stash@{0}: WIP on master: 049d078 added the index file
stash@{1}: WIP on master: c264051 Revert "added file_size"
stash@{2}: WIP on master: 21d80a5 added number to log
$ git stash drop stash@{0}
Dropped stash@{0} (364e91f3f268f0900bc3ee613f9f733e82aaed43)</pre>
</figure>

<p >You can also run <code>git stash pop</code> to apply the stash and then immediately drop it from your stack.</p>

</section>

<section class="section" id="_creative_stashing">
  <h3>Creative Stashing</h3>
  <p >There are a few stash variants that may also be helpful.
The first option that is quite popular is the <code>--keep-index</code> option to the <code>git stash</code> command.
This tells Git to not only include all staged content in the stash being created, but simultaneously leave it in the index.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git status -s
M  index.html
 M lib/simplegit.rb

$ git stash --keep-index
Saved working directory and index state WIP on master: 1b65b17 added the index file
HEAD is now at 1b65b17 added the index file

$ git status -s
M  index.html</pre>
</figure>

<p >Another common thing you may want to do with stash is to stash the untracked files as well as the tracked ones.
By default, <code>git stash</code> will stash only modified and staged <em>tracked</em> files.
If you specify <code>--include-untracked</code> or <code>-u</code>, Git will include untracked files in the stash being created.
However, including untracked files in the stash will still not include explicitly <em>ignored</em> files; to additionally include ignored files, use <code>--all</code> (or just <code>-a</code>).</p>

  <h3>Creating a Branch from a Stash</h3>
  <p >If you stash some work, leave it there for a while, and continue on the branch from which you stashed the work, you may have a problem reapplying the work.
If the apply tries to modify a file that you&#8217;ve since modified, you&#8217;ll get a merge conflict and will have to try to resolve it.
If you want an easier way to test the stashed changes again, you can run <code>git stash branch &lt;new branchname&gt;</code>, which creates a new branch for you with your selected branch name, checks out the commit you were on when you stashed your work, reapplies your work there, and then drops the stash if it applies successfully:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git stash branch testchanges
M	index.html
M	lib/simplegit.rb
Switched to a new branch 'testchanges'
On branch testchanges
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

	modified:   index.html

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   lib/simplegit.rb

Dropped refs/stash@{0} (29d385a81d163dfd45a452a2ce816487a6b8b014)</pre>

<p >This is a nice shortcut to recover stashed work easily and work on it in a new branch.</p>

<section class="section" id="_git_clean">
  <h3>Cleaning your Working Directory</h3>
  <p >Finally, you may not want to stash some work or files in your working directory, but simply get rid of them; that&#8217;s what the <code>git clean</code> command is for.</p>

<p >Some common reasons for cleaning your working directory might be to remove cruft that has been generated by merges or external tools or to remove build artifacts in order to run a clean build.</p>

<p >You&#8217;ll want to be pretty careful with this command, since it&#8217;s designed to remove files from your working directory that are not tracked.
If you change your mind, there is often no retrieving the content of those files.
A safer option is to run <code>git stash --all</code> to remove everything but save it in a stash.</p>

<p >Assuming you do want to remove cruft files or clean your working directory, you can do so with <code>git clean</code>.
To remove all the untracked files in your working directory, you can run <code>git clean -f -d</code>, which removes any files and also any subdirectories that become empty as a result.
The <code>-f</code> means 'force' or <code>`really do this,'' and is required if the Git configuration variable `clean.requireForce</code> is not explicitly set to false.</p>

<p >If you ever want to see what it would do, you can run the command with the <code>--dry-run</code> (or <code>-n</code>) option, which means ``do a dry run and tell me what you <em>would</em> have removed''.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git clean -d -n
Would remove test.o
Would remove tmp/</pre>
</figure>

<p >By default, the <code>git clean</code> command will only remove untracked files that are not ignored.
Any file that matches a pattern in your <code>.gitignore</code> or other ignore files will not be removed.
If you want to remove those files too, such as to remove all <code>.o</code> files generated from a build so you can do a fully clean build, you can add a <code>-x</code> to the clean command.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git status -s
 M lib/simplegit.rb
?? build.TMP
?? tmp/

$ git clean -n -d
Would remove build.TMP
Would remove tmp/

$ git clean -n -d -x
Would remove build.TMP
Would remove test.o
Would remove tmp/</pre>
</figure>

<p >If you don&#8217;t know what the <code>git clean</code> command is going to do, always run it with a <code>-n</code> first to double check before changing the <code>-n</code> to a <code>-f</code> and doing it for real.
The other way you can be careful about the process is to run it with the <code>-i</code> or ``interactive'' flag.</p>

<p >This will run the clean command in an interactive mode.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git clean -x -i
Would remove the following items:
  build.TMP  test.o
*** Commands ***
    1: clean                2: filter by pattern    3: select by numbers    4: ask each             5: quit
    6: help
What now&gt;</pre>
</figure>

<p >This way you can step through each file individually or specify patterns for deletion interactively.</p>

<div class="admonition admonition-note" >
  <div class="admonition-icon">
  </div>
  <div class="admonition-content">
    
    <p >There is a quirky situation where you might need to be extra forceful in asking Git to clean your working directory.
If you happen to be in a working directory under which you&#8217;ve copied or cloned other Git repositories (perhaps as submodules), even <code>git clean -fd</code> will refuse to delete those directories.
In cases like that, you need to add a second <code>-f</code> option for emphasis.</p>

  <h2>Signing Your Work</h2>
  <p >Git is cryptographically secure, but it&#8217;s not foolproof.
If you&#8217;re taking work from others on the internet and want to verify that commits are actually from a trusted source, Git has a few ways to sign and verify work using GPG.</p>

<section class="section" id="_gpg_introduction">
  <h3>GPG Introduction</h3>
  <p >First of all, if you want to sign anything you need to get GPG configured and your personal key installed.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ gpg --list-keys
/Users/schacon/.gnupg/pubring.gpg
---------------------------------
pub   2048R/0A46826A 2014-06-04

sub   2048R/874529A9 2014-06-04</pre>
</figure>

<p >If you don&#8217;t have a key installed, you can generate one with <code>gpg --gen-key</code>.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ gpg --gen-key</pre>
</figure>

<p >Once you have a private key to sign with, you can configure Git to use it for signing things by setting the <code>user.signingkey</code> config setting.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git config --global user.signingkey 0A46826A</pre>
</figure>

<p >Now Git will use your key by default to sign tags and commits if you want.</p>

</section>

<section class="section" id="_signing_tags">
  <h3>Signing Tags</h3>
  <p >If you have a GPG private key setup, you can now use it to sign new tags.
All you have to do is use <code>-s</code> instead of <code>-a</code>:</p>

<figure class="listing" >

<section class="section" id="_searching">
  <h2>Searching</h2>
  <p >With just about any size codebase, you&#8217;ll often need to find where a function is called or defined, or display the history of a method.
Git provides a couple of useful tools for looking through the code and commits stored in its database quickly and easily.
We&#8217;ll go through a few of them.</p>

<section class="section" id="_git_grep">
  <h3>Git Grep</h3>
  <p >Git ships with a command called <code>grep</code> that allows you to easily search through any committed tree, the working directory, or even the index for a string or regular expression.
For the examples that follow, we&#8217;ll search through the source code for Git itself.</p>

<p >By default, <code>git grep</code> will look through the files in your working directory.
As a first variation, you can use either of the <code>-n</code> or <code>--line-number</code> options to print out the line numbers where Git has found matches:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git grep -n gmtime_r
compat/gmtime.c:3:#undef gmtime_r
compat/gmtime.c:8:      return git_gmtime_r(timep, &amp;result);
compat/gmtime.c:11:struct tm *git_gmtime_r(const time_t *timep, struct tm *result)
compat/gmtime.c:16:     ret = gmtime_r(timep, result);
compat/mingw.c:826:struct tm *gmtime_r(const time_t *timep, struct tm *result)
compat/mingw.h:206:struct tm *gmtime_r(const time_t *timep, struct tm *result);
date.c:482:             if (gmtime_r(&amp;now, &amp;now_tm))
date.c:545:             if (gmtime_r(&amp;time, tm)) {
date.c:758:             /* gmtime_r() in match_digit() may have clobbered it */
git-compat-util.h:1138:struct tm *git_gmtime_r(const time_t *, struct tm *);
git-compat-util.h:1140:#define gmtime_r git_gmtime_r</pre>
</figure>

<p >In addition to the basic search shown above, <code>git grep</code> supports a plethora of other interesting options.</p>

<p >For instance, instead of printing all of the matches, you can ask <code>git grep</code> to summarize the output by showing you only which files contained the search string and how many matches there were in each file with the <code>-c</code> or <code>--count</code> option:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git grep --count gmtime_r
compat/gmtime.c:4
compat/mingw.c:1
compat/mingw.h:1
date.c:3
git-compat-util.h:2</pre>
</figure>

<p >If you&#8217;re interested in the <em>context</em> of a search string, you can display the enclosing method or function for each matching string with either of the <code>-p</code> or <code>--show-function</code> options:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git grep -p gmtime_r *.c
date.c=static int match_multi_number(timestamp_t num, char c, const char *date,
date.c:         if (gmtime_r(&amp;now, &amp;now_tm))
date.c=static int match_digit(const char *date, struct tm *tm, int *offset, int *tm_gmt)
date.c:         if (gmtime_r(&amp;time, tm)) {
date.c=int parse_date_basic(const char *date, timestamp_t *timestamp, int *offset)
date.c:         /* gmtime_r() in match_digit() may have clobbered it */</pre>
</figure>

<p >As you can see, the <code>gmtime_r</code> routine is called from both the <code>match_multi_number</code> and <code>match_digit</code> functions in the <code>date.c</code> file (the third match displayed represents just the string appearing in a comment).</p>

<p >You can also search for complex combinations of strings with the <code>--and</code> flag, which ensures that multiple matches must occur in the same line of text.
For instance, let&#8217;s look for any lines that define a constant whose name contains <em>either</em> of the substrings <code>LINK'' or </code>BUF_MAX'', specifically in an older version of the Git codebase represented by the tag <code>v1.8.0</code> (we&#8217;ll throw in the <code>--break</code> and <code>--heading</code> options which help split up the output into a more readable format):</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git grep --break --heading \
    -n -e '#define' --and \( -e LINK -e BUF_MAX \) v1.8.0
v1.8.0:builtin/index-pack.c
62:#define FLAG_LINK (1u&lt;&lt;20)

v1.8.0:cache.h
73:#define S_IFGITLINK  0160000
74:#define S_ISGITLINK(m)       (((m) &amp; S_IFMT) == S_IFGITLINK)

v1.8.0:environment.c
54:#define OBJECT_CREATION_MODE OBJECT_CREATION_USES_HARDLINKS

v1.8.0:strbuf.c
326:#define STRBUF_MAXLINK (2*PATH_MAX)

v1.8.0:symlinks.c
53:#define FL_SYMLINK  (1 &lt;&lt; 2)

v1.8.0:zlib.c
30:/* #define ZLIB_BUF_MAX ((uInt)-1) */
31:#define ZLIB_BUF_MAX ((uInt) 1024 * 1024 * 1024) /* 1GB */</pre>
</figure>

<p >The <code>git grep</code> command has a few advantages over normal searching commands like <code>grep</code> and <code>ack</code>.
The first is that it&#8217;s really fast, the second is that you can search through any tree in Git, not just the working directory.
As we saw in the above example, we looked for terms in an older version of the Git source code, not the version that was currently checked out.</p>

</section>

<section class="section" id="_git_log_searching">
  <h3>Git Log Searching</h3>
  <p >Perhaps you&#8217;re looking not for <em>where</em> a term exists, but <em>when</em> it existed or was introduced.
The <code>git log</code> command has a number of powerful tools for finding specific commits by the content of their messages or even the content of the diff they introduce.</p>

<p >If, for example, we want to find out when the <code>ZLIB_BUF_MAX</code> constant was originally introduced, we can use the <code>-S</code> option (colloquially referred to as the Git ``pickaxe'' option) to tell Git to show us only those commits that changed the number of occurrences of that string.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git log -S ZLIB_BUF_MAX --oneline
e01503b zlib: allow feeding more than 4GB in one go
ef49a7a zlib: zlib can only process 4GB at a time</pre>
</figure>

<p >If we look at the diff of those commits, we can see that in <code>ef49a7a</code> the constant was introduced and in <code>e01503b</code> it was modified.</p>

<p >If you need to be more specific, you can provide a regular expression to search for with the <code>-G</code> option.</p>

<section class="section" id="_line_log_search">
  <h4>Line Log Search</h4>
  <p >Another fairly advanced log search that is insanely useful is the line history search.
Simply run <code>git log</code> with the <code>-L</code> option, and it will show you the history of a function or line of code in your codebase.</p>

<p >For example, if we wanted to see every change made to the function <code>git_deflate_bound</code> in the <code>zlib.c</code> file, we could run <code>git log -L :git_deflate_bound:zlib.c</code>.
This will try to figure out what the bounds of that function are and then look through the history and show us every change that was made to the function as a series of patches back to when the function was first created.</p>

<p >If Git can&#8217;t figure out how to match a function or method in your programming language, you can also provide it with a regular expression (or <em>regex</em>).
For example, this would have done the same thing as the example above: <code>git log -L '/unsigned long git_deflate_bound/',/^}/:zlib.c</code>.
You could also give it a range of lines or a single line number and you&#8217;ll get the same sort of output.</p>

<section class="section" id="_rewriting_history">
  <h2>Rewriting History</h2>
  <p >Many times, when working with Git, you may want to revise your local commit history.
One of the great things about Git is that it allows you to make decisions at the last possible moment.
You can decide what files go into which commits right before you commit with the staging area, you can decide that you didn&#8217;t mean to be working on something yet with <code>git stash</code>, and you can rewrite commits that already happened so they look like they happened in a different way.
This can involve changing the order of the commits, changing messages or modifying files in a commit, squashing together or splitting apart commits, or removing commits entirely&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;all before you share your work with others.</p>

<p >In this section, you&#8217;ll see how to accomplish these tasks so that you can make your commit history look the way you want before you share it with others.</p>

    <h5>Don&#8217;t push your work until you&#8217;re happy with it</h5>
    <p >One of the cardinal rules of Git is that, since so much work is local within your clone, you have a great deal of freedom to rewrite your history <em>locally</em>.
However, once you push your work, it is a different story entirely, and you should consider pushed work as final unless you have good reason to change it.
In short, you should avoid pushing your work until you&#8217;re happy with it and ready to share it with the rest of the world.</p>

  <h3>Changing the Last Commit</h3>
  <p >Changing your most recent commit is probably the most common rewriting of history that you&#8217;ll do.
You&#8217;ll often want to do two basic things to your last commit: simply change the commit message, or change the actual content of the commit by adding, removing and modifying files.</p>

<p >If you simply want to modify your last commit message, that&#8217;s easy:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git commit --amend</pre>
</figure>

<p >The command above loads the previous commit message into an editor session, where you can make changes to the message, save those changes and exit.
When you save and close the editor, the editor writes a new commit containing that updated commit message and makes it your new last commit.</p>

<p >If, on the other hand, you want to change the actual <em>content</em> of your last commit, the process works basically the same way&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;first make the changes you think you forgot, stage those changes, and the subsequent <code>git commit --amend</code> <em>replaces</em> that last commit with your new, improved commit.</p>

<p >You need to be careful with this technique because amending changes the SHA-1 of the commit.
It&#8217;s like a very small rebase&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;don&#8217;t amend your last commit if you&#8217;ve already pushed it.</p>

  <div class="admonition-content">
    <h5>An amended commit may (or may not) need an amended commit message</h5>
    <p >When you amend a commit, you have the opportunity to change both the commit message and the content of the commit.
If you amend the content of the commit substantially, you should almost certainly update the commit message to reflect that amended content.</p>

<p >On the other hand, if your amendments are suitably trivial (fixing a silly typo or adding a file you forgot to stage) such that the earlier commit message is just fine, you can simply make the changes, stage them, and avoid the unnecessary editor session entirely with:</p>

<section class="section" id="_changing_multiple">
  <h3>Changing Multiple Commit Messages</h3>
  <p >To modify a commit that is farther back in your history, you must move to more complex tools.
Git doesn&#8217;t have a modify-history tool, but you can use the rebase tool to rebase a series of commits onto the HEAD they were originally based on instead of moving them to another one.
With the interactive rebase tool, you can then stop after each commit you want to modify and change the message, add files, or do whatever you wish.
You can run rebase interactively by adding the <code>-i</code> option to <code>git rebase</code>.
You must indicate how far back you want to rewrite commits by telling the command which commit to rebase onto.</p>

<p >For example, if you want to change the last three commit messages, or any of the commit messages in that group, you supply as an argument to <code>git rebase -i</code> the parent of the last commit you want to edit, which is <code>HEAD~2^</code> or <code>HEAD~3</code>.
It may be easier to remember the <code>~3</code> because you&#8217;re trying to edit the last three commits, but keep in mind that you&#8217;re actually designating four commits ago, the parent of the last commit you want to edit:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git rebase -i HEAD~3</pre>
</figure>

<p >Remember again that this is a rebasing command&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;every commit in the range <code>HEAD~3..HEAD</code> with a changed message <em>and all of its descendants</em> will be rewritten.
Don&#8217;t include any commit you&#8217;ve already pushed to a central server&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;doing so will confuse other developers by providing an alternate version of the same change.</p>

<p >Running this command gives you a list of commits in your text editor that looks something like this:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>pick f7f3f6d changed my name a bit
pick 310154e updated README formatting and added blame
pick a5f4a0d added cat-file

# Rebase 710f0f8..a5f4a0d onto 710f0f8
#
# Commands:
# p, pick &lt;commit&gt; = use commit
# r, reword &lt;commit&gt; = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit &lt;commit&gt; = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash &lt;commit&gt; = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup &lt;commit&gt; = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
# x, exec &lt;command&gt; = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
# b, break = stop here (continue rebase later with 'git rebase --continue')
# d, drop &lt;commit&gt; = remove commit
# l, label &lt;label&gt; = label current HEAD with a name
# t, reset &lt;label&gt; = reset HEAD to a label
# m, merge [-C &lt;commit&gt; | -c &lt;commit&gt;] &lt;label&gt; [# &lt;oneline&gt;]
# .       create a merge commit using the original merge commit's
# .       message (or the oneline, if no original merge commit was
# .       specified). Use -c &lt;commit&gt; to reword the commit message.
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
# Note that empty commits are commented out</pre>
</figure>

<p >It&#8217;s important to note that these commits are listed in the opposite order than you normally see them using the <code>log</code> command.
If you run a <code>log</code>, you see something like this:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git log --pretty=format:"%h %s" HEAD~3..HEAD
a5f4a0d added cat-file
310154e updated README formatting and added blame
f7f3f6d changed my name a bit</pre>
</figure>

<p >Notice the reverse order.
The interactive rebase gives you a script that it&#8217;s going to run.
It will start at the commit you specify on the command line (<code>HEAD~3</code>) and replay the changes introduced in each of these commits from top to bottom.
It lists the oldest at the top, rather than the newest, because that&#8217;s the first one it will replay.</p>

<p >You need to edit the script so that it stops at the commit you want to edit.
To do so, change the word `pick' to the word `edit' for each of the commits you want the script to stop after.
For example, to modify only the third commit message, you change the file to look like this:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>edit f7f3f6d changed my name a bit
pick 310154e updated README formatting and added blame
pick a5f4a0d added cat-file</pre>
</figure>

<p >When you save and exit the editor, Git rewinds you back to the last commit in that list and drops you on the command line with the following message:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git rebase -i HEAD~3
Stopped at f7f3f6d... changed my name a bit
You can amend the commit now, with

       git commit --amend

Once you're satisfied with your changes, run

       git rebase --continue</pre>
</figure>

<p >These instructions tell you exactly what to do.
Type</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git commit --amend</pre>
</figure>

<p >Change the commit message, and exit the editor.
Then, run</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git rebase --continue</pre>
</figure>

<p >This command will apply the other two commits automatically, and then you&#8217;re done.
If you change pick to edit on more lines, you can repeat these steps for each commit you change to edit.
Each time, Git will stop, let you amend the commit, and continue when you&#8217;re finished.</p>

</section>

<section class="section" id="_reordering_commits">
  <h3>Reordering Commits</h3>
  <p >You can also use interactive rebases to reorder or remove commits entirely.
If you want to remove the ``added cat-file'' commit and change the order in which the other two commits are introduced, you can change the rebase script from this</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>pick f7f3f6d changed my name a bit
pick 310154e updated README formatting and added blame
pick a5f4a0d added cat-file</pre>
</figure>

<p >to this:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>pick 310154e updated README formatting and added blame
pick f7f3f6d changed my name a bit</pre>
</figure>

<p >When you save and exit the editor, Git rewinds your branch to the parent of these commits, applies <code>310154e</code> and then <code>f7f3f6d</code>, and then stops.
You effectively change the order of those commits and remove the ``added cat-file'' commit completely.</p>

</section>

<section class="section" id="_squashing">
  <h3>Squashing Commits</h3>
  <p >It&#8217;s also possible to take a series of commits and squash them down into a single commit with the interactive rebasing tool.
The script puts helpful instructions in the rebase message:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>#
# Commands:
# p, pick &lt;commit&gt; = use commit
# r, reword &lt;commit&gt; = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit &lt;commit&gt; = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash &lt;commit&gt; = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup &lt;commit&gt; = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
# x, exec &lt;command&gt; = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
# b, break = stop here (continue rebase later with 'git rebase --continue')
# d, drop &lt;commit&gt; = remove commit
# l, label &lt;label&gt; = label current HEAD with a name
# t, reset &lt;label&gt; = reset HEAD to a label
# m, merge [-C &lt;commit&gt; | -c &lt;commit&gt;] &lt;label&gt; [# &lt;oneline&gt;]
# .       create a merge commit using the original merge commit's
# .       message (or the oneline, if no original merge commit was
# .       specified). Use -c &lt;commit&gt; to reword the commit message.
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
# Note that empty commits are commented out</pre>
</figure>

<p >If, instead of <code>pick'' or </code>edit'', you specify ``squash'', Git applies both that change and the change directly before it and makes you merge the commit messages together.
So, if you want to make a single commit from these three commits, you make the script look like this:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>pick f7f3f6d changed my name a bit
squash 310154e updated README formatting and added blame
squash a5f4a0d added cat-file</pre>
</figure>

<p >When you save and exit the editor, Git applies all three changes and then puts you back into the editor to merge the three commit messages:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre># This is a combination of 3 commits.
# The first commit's message is:
changed my name a bit

# This is the 2nd commit message:

updated README formatting and added blame

# This is the 3rd commit message:

added cat-file</pre>
</figure>

<p >When you save that, you have a single commit that introduces the changes of all three previous commits.</p>

</section>

<section class="section" id="_splitting_a_commit">
  <h3>Splitting a Commit</h3>
  <p >Splitting a commit undoes a commit and then partially stages and commits as many times as commits you want to end up with.
For example, suppose you want to split the middle commit of your three commits.
Instead of <code>updated README formatting and added blame'', you want to split it into two commits: </code>updated README formatting'' for the first, and <code>added blame'' for the second.
You can do that in the <code>rebase -i</code> script by changing the instruction on the commit you want to split to </code>edit'':</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>pick f7f3f6d changed my name a bit
edit 310154e updated README formatting and added blame
pick a5f4a0d added cat-file</pre>
</figure>

<p >Then, when the script drops you to the command line, you reset that commit, take the changes that have been reset, and create multiple commits out of them.
When you save and exit the editor, Git rewinds to the parent of the first commit in your list, applies the first commit (<code>f7f3f6d</code>), applies the second (<code>310154e</code>), and drops you to the console.
There, you can do a mixed reset of that commit with <code>git reset HEAD^</code>, which effectively undoes that commit and leaves the modified files unstaged.
Now you can stage and commit files until you have several commits, and run <code>git rebase --continue</code> when you&#8217;re done:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git reset HEAD^
$ git add README
$ git commit -m 'updated README formatting'
$ git add lib/simplegit.rb
$ git commit -m 'added blame'
$ git rebase --continue</pre>
</figure>

<p >Git applies the last commit (<code>a5f4a0d</code>) in the script, and your history looks like this:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git log -4 --pretty=format:"%h %s"
1c002dd added cat-file
9b29157 added blame
35cfb2b updated README formatting
f3cc40e changed my name a bit</pre>
</figure>

<p >Once again, this changes the SHA-1s of all the commits in your list, so make sure no commit shows up in that list that you&#8217;ve already pushed to a shared repository.</p>

</section>

<section class="section" id="_the_nuclear_option_filter_branch">
  <h3>The Nuclear Option: filter-branch</h3>
  <p >There is another history-rewriting option that you can use if you need to rewrite a larger number of commits in some scriptable way&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;for instance, changing your email address globally or removing a file from every commit.
The command is <code>filter-branch</code>, and it can rewrite huge swaths of your history, so you probably shouldn&#8217;t use it unless your project isn&#8217;t yet public and other people haven&#8217;t based work off the commits you&#8217;re about to rewrite.
However, it can be very useful.
You&#8217;ll learn a few of the common uses so you can get an idea of some of the things it&#8217;s capable of.</p>

<div class="admonition admonition-caution" >
  <div class="admonition-icon">
  </div>
  <div class="admonition-content">
    
    <p ><code>git filter-branch</code> has many pitfalls, and is no longer the recommended way to rewrite history.
Instead, consider using <code>git-filter-repo</code>, which is a Python script that does a better job for most applications where you would normally turn to <code>filter-branch</code>.
Its documentation and source code can be found at <a class="link" href="https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo"

<section class="section" id="_removing_file_every_commit">
  <h4>Removing a File from Every Commit</h4>
  <p >This occurs fairly commonly.
Someone accidentally commits a huge binary file with a thoughtless <code>git add .</code>, and you want to remove it everywhere.
Perhaps you accidentally committed a file that contained a password, and you want to make your project open source.
<code>filter-branch</code> is the tool you probably want to use to scrub your entire history.
To remove a file named <code>passwords.txt</code> from your entire history, you can use the <code>--tree-filter</code> option to <code>filter-branch</code>:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -f passwords.txt' HEAD
Rewrite 6b9b3cf04e7c5686a9cb838c3f36a8cb6a0fc2bd (21/21)
Ref 'refs/heads/master' was rewritten</pre>
</figure>

<p >The <code>--tree-filter</code> option runs the specified command after each checkout of the project and then recommits the results.
In this case, you remove a file called <code>passwords.txt</code> from every snapshot, whether it exists or not.
If you want to remove all accidentally committed editor backup files, you can run something like <code>git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -f *~' HEAD</code>.</p>

<p >You&#8217;ll be able to watch Git rewriting trees and commits and then move the branch pointer at the end.
It&#8217;s generally a good idea to do this in a testing branch and then hard-reset your <code>master</code> branch after you&#8217;ve determined the outcome is what you really want.
To run <code>filter-branch</code> on all your branches, you can pass <code>--all</code> to the command.</p>

</section>

<section class="section" id="_making_a_subdirectory_the_new_root">
  <h4>Making a Subdirectory the New Root</h4>
  <p >Suppose you&#8217;ve done an import from another source control system and have subdirectories that make no sense (<code>trunk</code>, <code>tags</code>, and so on).
If you want to make the <code>trunk</code> subdirectory be the new project root for every commit, <code>filter-branch</code> can help you do that, too:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git filter-branch --subdirectory-filter trunk HEAD
Rewrite 856f0bf61e41a27326cdae8f09fe708d679f596f (12/12)
Ref 'refs/heads/master' was rewritten</pre>
</figure>

<p >Now your new project root is what was in the <code>trunk</code> subdirectory each time.
Git will also automatically remove commits that did not affect the subdirectory.</p>

</section>

<section class="section" id="_changing_email_addresses_globally">
  <h4>Changing Email Addresses Globally</h4>
  <p >Another common case is that you forgot to run <code>git config</code> to set your name and email address before you started working, or perhaps you want to open-source a project at work and change all your work email addresses to your personal address.
In any case, you can change email addresses in multiple commits in a batch with <code>filter-branch</code> as well.
You need to be careful to change only the email addresses that are yours, so you use <code>--commit-filter</code>:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git filter-branch --commit-filter '
        if [ "$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL" = "schacon@localhost" ];
        then
                GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="Scott Chacon";
                GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="schacon@example.com";
                git commit-tree "$@";
        else
                git commit-tree "$@";
        fi' HEAD</pre>
</figure>

<p >This goes through and rewrites every commit to have your new address.
Because commits contain the SHA-1 values of their parents, this command changes every commit SHA-1 in your history, not just those that have the matching email address.</p>

</section>

<section class="section" id="_git_reset">
  <h2>Reset Demystified</h2>
  <p >Before moving on to more specialized tools, let&#8217;s talk about the Git <code>reset</code> and <code>checkout</code> commands.
These commands are two of the most confusing parts of Git when you first encounter them.
They do so many things that it seems hopeless to actually understand them and employ them properly.
For this, we recommend a simple metaphor.</p>

<section class="section" id="_the_three_trees">
  <h3>The Three Trees</h3>
  <p >An easier way to think about <code>reset</code> and <code>checkout</code> is through the mental frame of Git being a content manager of three different trees.
By <code>tree'' here, we really mean </code>collection of files'', not specifically the data structure.
(There are a few cases where the index doesn&#8217;t exactly act like a tree, but for our purposes it is easier to think about it this way for now.)</p>

<p >Git as a system manages and manipulates three trees in its normal operation:</p>

<table class="table" >
  
  
    <thead>
      
        <tr>

<section class="section" id="_the_head">
  <h4>The HEAD</h4>
  <p >HEAD is the pointer to the current branch reference, which is in turn a pointer to the last commit made on that branch.
That means HEAD will be the parent of the next commit that is created.
It&#8217;s generally simplest to think of HEAD as the snapshot of <strong>your last commit on that branch</strong>.</p>

<p >In fact, it&#8217;s pretty easy to see what that snapshot looks like.
Here is an example of getting the actual directory listing and SHA-1 checksums for each file in the HEAD snapshot:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git cat-file -p HEAD
tree cfda3bf379e4f8dba8717dee55aab78aef7f4daf

040000 tree 99f1a6d12cb4b6f19...   lib</pre>
</figure>

<p >The Git <code>cat-file</code> and <code>ls-tree</code> commands are ``plumbing'' commands that are used for lower level things and not really used in day-to-day work, but they help us see what&#8217;s going on here.</p>

</section>

<section class="section" id="_the_index">
  <h4>The Index</h4>
  <p >The <em>index</em> is your <strong>proposed next commit</strong>.
We&#8217;ve also been referring to this concept as Git&#8217;s <code>`Staging Area'' as this is what Git looks at when you run `git commit</code>.</p>

<p >Git populates this index with a list of all the file contents that were last checked out into your working directory and what they looked like when they were originally checked out.
You then replace some of those files with new versions of them, and <code>git commit</code> converts that into the tree for a new commit.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git ls-files -s
100644 a906cb2a4a904a152e80877d4088654daad0c859 0	README

</figure>

<p >Again, here we&#8217;re using <code>git ls-files</code>, which is more of a behind the scenes command that shows you what your index currently looks like.</p>

<p >The index is not technically a tree structure&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;it&#8217;s actually implemented as a flattened manifest&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;but for our purposes it&#8217;s close enough.</p>

<section class="section" id="_the_working_directory">
  <h4>The Working Directory</h4>
  <p >Finally, you have your <em>working directory</em> (also commonly referred to as the <code>`working tree'').
The other two trees store their content in an efficient but inconvenient manner, inside the `.git</code> folder.
The working directory unpacks them into actual files, which makes it much easier for you to edit them.
Think of the working directory as a <strong>sandbox</strong>, where you can try changes out before committing them to your staging area (index) and then to history.</p>

          />
  
  
</figure>

<p >Let&#8217;s visualize this process: say you go into a new directory with a single file in it.
We&#8217;ll call this <strong>v1</strong> of the file, and we&#8217;ll indicate it in blue.
Now we run <code>git init</code>, which will create a Git repository with a HEAD reference which points to the unborn <code>master</code> branch.</p>

<figure class="image" >
  
    <img src="images/reset-ex1.png"
         alt="reset ex1"
         
          />
  
  
</figure>

<p >At this point, only the working directory tree has any content.</p>

<p >Now we want to commit this file, so we use <code>git add</code> to take content in the working directory and copy it to the index.</p>

<figure class="image" >
  
    <img src="images/reset-ex2.png"
         alt="reset ex2"
         
          />
  
  
</figure>

<p >Then we run <code>git commit</code>, which takes the contents of the index and saves it as a permanent snapshot, creates a commit object which points to that snapshot, and updates <code>master</code> to point to that commit.</p>

<figure class="image" >
  
    <img src="images/reset-ex3.png"
         alt="reset ex3"
         
          />
  
  
</figure>

<p >If we run <code>git status</code>, we&#8217;ll see no changes, because all three trees are the same.</p>

<p >Now we want to make a change to that file and commit it.
We&#8217;ll go through the same process; first, we change the file in our working directory.
Let&#8217;s call this <strong>v2</strong> of the file, and indicate it in red.</p>

<figure class="image" >
  
    <img src="images/reset-ex4.png"
         alt="reset ex4"
         
          />
  
  
</figure>

<p >If we run <code>git status</code> right now, we&#8217;ll see the file in red as <code>`Changes not staged for commit'', because that entry differs between the index and the working directory.
Next we run `git add</code> on it to stage it into our index.</p>

<figure class="image" >
  
    <img src="images/reset-ex5.png"
         alt="reset ex5"
         
          />
  
  
</figure>

<p >At this point, if we run <code>git status</code>, we will see the file in green under <code>`Changes to be committed'' because the index and HEAD differ&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;that is, our proposed next commit is now different from our last commit.
Finally, we run `git commit</code> to finalize the commit.</p>

<figure class="image" >
  
    <img src="images/reset-ex6.png"
         alt="reset ex6"
         
          />
  
  
</figure>

<p >Now <code>git status</code> will give us no output, because all three trees are the same again.</p>

<p >Switching branches or cloning goes through a similar process.
When you checkout a branch, it changes <strong>HEAD</strong> to point to the new branch ref, populates your <strong>index</strong> with the snapshot of that commit, then copies the contents of the <strong>index</strong> into your <strong>working Directory</strong>.</p>

</section>

<section class="section" id="_the_role_of_reset">
  <h3>The Role of Reset</h3>
  <p >The <code>reset</code> command makes more sense when viewed in this context.</p>

<p >For the purposes of these examples, let&#8217;s say that we&#8217;ve modified <code>file.txt</code> again and committed it a third time.
So now our history looks like this:</p>

<figure class="image" >
  
    <img src="images/reset-start.png"
         alt="reset start"
         
          />
  
  
</figure>

<p >Let&#8217;s now walk through exactly what <code>reset</code> does when you call it.
It directly manipulates these three trees in a simple and predictable way.
It does up to three basic operations.</p>

<section class="section" id="_step_1_move_head">
  <h4>Step 1: Move HEAD</h4>
  <p >The first thing <code>reset</code> will do is move what HEAD points to.
This isn&#8217;t the same as changing HEAD itself (which is what <code>checkout</code> does); <code>reset</code> moves the branch that HEAD is pointing to.
This means if HEAD is set to the <code>master</code> branch (i.e. you&#8217;re currently on the <code>master</code> branch), running <code>git reset 9e5e6a4</code> will start by making <code>master</code> point to <code>9e5e6a4</code>.</p>

<figure class="image" >
  
    <img src="images/reset-soft.png"
         alt="reset soft"
         
          />
  
  
</figure>

<p >No matter what form of <code>reset</code> with a commit you invoke, this is the first thing it will always try to do.
With <code>reset --soft</code>, it will simply stop there.</p>

<p >Now take a second to look at that diagram and realize what happened: it essentially undid the last <code>git commit</code> command.
When you run <code>git commit</code>, Git creates a new commit and moves the branch that HEAD points to up to it.
When you <code>reset</code> back to <code>HEAD~</code> (the parent of HEAD), you are moving the branch back to where it was, without changing the index or working directory.
You could now update the index and run <code>git commit</code> again to accomplish what <code>git commit --amend</code> would have done (see <a class="xref" href="ch07-git-tools.html#_git_amend">Changing the Last Commit</a>).</p>

</section>

<section class="section" id="_step_2_updating_the_index_mixed">
  <h4>Step 2: Updating the Index (--mixed)</h4>
  <p >Note that if you run <code>git status</code> now you&#8217;ll see in green the difference between the index and what the new HEAD is.</p>

<p >The next thing <code>reset</code> will do is to update the index with the contents of whatever snapshot HEAD now points to.</p>

<figure class="image" >
  
    <img src="images/reset-mixed.png"
         alt="reset mixed"
         
          />
  
  
</figure>

<p >If you specify the <code>--mixed</code> option, <code>reset</code> will stop at this point.
This is also the default, so if you specify no option at all (just <code>git reset HEAD~</code> in this case), this is where the command will stop.</p>

<p >Now take another second to look at that diagram and realize what happened: it still undid your last <code>commit</code>, but also <em>unstaged</em> everything.
You rolled back to before you ran all your <code>git add</code> and <code>git commit</code> commands.</p>

</section>

<section class="section" id="_step_3_updating_the_working_directory_hard">
  <h4>Step 3: Updating the Working Directory (--hard)</h4>
  <p >The third thing that <code>reset</code> will do is to make the working directory look like the index.
If you use the <code>--hard</code> option, it will continue to this stage.</p>

<figure class="image" >
  
    <img src="images/reset-hard.png"
         alt="reset hard"
         
          />
  
  
</figure>

<p >So let&#8217;s think about what just happened.
You undid your last commit, the <code>git add</code> and <code>git commit</code> commands, <strong>and</strong> all the work you did in your working directory.</p>

<p >It&#8217;s important to note that this flag (<code>--hard</code>) is the only way to make the <code>reset</code> command dangerous, and one of the very few cases where Git will actually destroy data.
Any other invocation of <code>reset</code> can be pretty easily undone, but the <code>--hard</code> option cannot, since it forcibly overwrites files in the working directory.
In this particular case, we still have the <strong>v3</strong> version of our file in a commit in our Git DB, and we could get it back by looking at our <code>reflog</code>, but if we had not committed it, Git still would have overwritten the file and it would be unrecoverable.</p>

</section>

<section class="section" id="_recap">
  <h4>Recap</h4>
  <p >The <code>reset</code> command overwrites these three trees in a specific order, stopping when you tell it to:</p>

<ol class="olist" >
  
    <li>
      <p>Move the branch HEAD points to <em>(stop here if <code>--soft</code>)</em></p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Make the index look like HEAD <em>(stop here unless <code>--hard</code>)</em></p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Make the working directory look like the index</p>
      
    </li>
  
</ol>

</section>

</section>

<section class="section" id="_reset_with_a_path">
  <h3>Reset With a Path</h3>
  <p >That covers the behavior of <code>reset</code> in its basic form, but you can also provide it with a path to act upon.
If you specify a path, <code>reset</code> will skip step 1, and limit the remainder of its actions to a specific file or set of files.
This actually sort of makes sense&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;HEAD is just a pointer, and you can&#8217;t point to part of one commit and part of another.
But the index and working directory <em>can</em> be partially updated, so reset proceeds with steps 2 and 3.</p>

<p >So, assume we run <code>git reset file.txt</code>.
This form (since you did not specify a commit SHA-1 or branch, and you didn&#8217;t specify <code>--soft</code> or <code>--hard</code>) is shorthand for <code>git reset --mixed HEAD file.txt</code>, which will:</p>

<ol class="olist" >
  
    <li>
      <p>Move the branch HEAD points to <em>(skipped)</em></p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Make the index look like HEAD <em>(stop here)</em></p>
      
    </li>
  
</ol>

<p >So it essentially just copies <code>file.txt</code> from HEAD to the index.</p>

<figure class="image" >
  
    <img src="images/reset-path1.png"
         alt="reset path1"
         
          />
  
  
</figure>

<p >This has the practical effect of <em>unstaging</em> the file.
If we look at the diagram for that command and think about what <code>git add</code> does, they are exact opposites.</p>

<figure class="image" >
  
    <img src="images/reset-path2.png"
         alt="reset path2"
         
          />
  
  
</figure>

<p >This is why the output of the <code>git status</code> command suggests that you run this to unstage a file.
(See <a class="xref" href="ch02-git-basics-chapter.html#_unstaging">Unstaging a Staged File</a> for more on this.)</p>

<p >We could just as easily not let Git assume we meant <code>`pull the data from HEAD'' by specifying a specific commit to pull that file version from.
We would just run something like `git reset eb43bf file.txt</code>.</p>

<figure class="image" >
  
    <img src="images/reset-path3.png"
         alt="reset path3"
         
          />
  
  
</figure>

<p >This effectively does the same thing as if we had reverted the content of the file to <strong>v1</strong> in the working directory, ran <code>git add</code> on it, then reverted it back to <strong>v3</strong> again (without actually going through all those steps).
If we run <code>git commit</code> now, it will record a change that reverts that file back to <strong>v1</strong>, even though we never actually had it in our working directory again.</p>

<p >It&#8217;s also interesting to note that like <code>git add</code>, the <code>reset</code> command will accept a <code>--patch</code> option to unstage content on a hunk-by-hunk basis.
So you can selectively unstage or revert content.</p>

</section>

<section class="section" id="_squashing_2">
  <h3>Squashing</h3>
  <p >Let&#8217;s look at how to do something interesting with this newfound power&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;squashing commits.</p>

<p >Say you have a series of commits with messages like <code>oops.'', </code>WIP'' and <code>`forgot this file''.
You can use `reset</code> to quickly and easily squash them into a single commit that makes you look really smart.
(<a class="xref" href="ch07-git-tools.html#_squashing">Squashing Commits</a> shows another way to do this, but in this example it&#8217;s simpler to use <code>reset</code>.)</p>

<p >Let&#8217;s say you have a project where the first commit has one file, the second commit added a new file and changed the first, and the third commit changed the first file again.
The second commit was a work in progress and you want to squash it down.</p>

<figure class="image" >
  
    <img src="images/reset-squash-r1.png"
         alt="reset squash r1"
         
          />
  
  
</figure>

<p >You can run <code>git reset --soft HEAD~2</code> to move the HEAD branch back to an older commit (the most recent commit you want to keep):</p>

<figure class="image" >
  
    <img src="images/reset-squash-r2.png"
         alt="reset squash r2"
         
          />
  
  
</figure>

<p >And then simply run <code>git commit</code> again:</p>

<figure class="image" >
  
    <img src="images/reset-squash-r3.png"
         alt="reset squash r3"
         
          />
  
  
</figure>

<p >Now you can see that your reachable history, the history you would push, now looks like you had one commit with <code>file-a.txt</code> v1, then a second that both modified <code>file-a.txt</code> to v3 and added <code>file-b.txt</code>.
The commit with the v2 version of the file is no longer in the history.</p>

</section>

<section class="section" id="_check_it_out">
  <h3>Check It Out</h3>
  <p >Finally, you may wonder what the difference between <code>checkout</code> and <code>reset</code> is.
Like <code>reset</code>, <code>checkout</code> manipulates the three trees, and it is a bit different depending on whether you give the command a file path or not.</p>

<section class="section" id="_without_paths">
  <h4>Without Paths</h4>
  <p >Running <code>git checkout [branch]</code> is pretty similar to running <code>git reset --hard [branch]</code> in that it updates all three trees for you to look like <code>[branch]</code>, but there are two important differences.</p>

<p >First, unlike <code>reset --hard</code>, <code>checkout</code> is working-directory safe; it will check to make sure it&#8217;s not blowing away files that have changes to them.
Actually, it&#8217;s a bit smarter than that&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;it tries to do a trivial merge in the working directory, so all of the files you <em>haven&#8217;t</em> changed will be updated.
<code>reset --hard</code>, on the other hand, will simply replace everything across the board without checking.</p>

<p >The second important difference is how <code>checkout</code> updates HEAD.
Whereas <code>reset</code> will move the branch that HEAD points to, <code>checkout</code> will move HEAD itself to point to another branch.</p>

<p >For instance, say we have <code>master</code> and <code>develop</code> branches which point at different commits, and we&#8217;re currently on <code>develop</code> (so HEAD points to it).
If we run <code>git reset master</code>, <code>develop</code> itself will now point to the same commit that <code>master</code> does.
If we instead run <code>git checkout master</code>, <code>develop</code> does not move, HEAD itself does.
HEAD will now point to <code>master</code>.</p>

<p >So, in both cases we&#8217;re moving HEAD to point to commit A, but <em>how</em> we do so is very different.
<code>reset</code> will move the branch HEAD points to, <code>checkout</code> moves HEAD itself.</p>

<figure class="image" >
  
    <img src="images/reset-checkout.png"
         alt="reset checkout"
         
          />
  
  
</figure>

</section>

<section class="section" id="_with_paths">
  <h4>With Paths</h4>
  <p >The other way to run <code>checkout</code> is with a file path, which, like <code>reset</code>, does not move HEAD.
It is just like <code>git reset [branch] file</code> in that it updates the index with that file at that commit, but it also overwrites the file in the working directory.
It would be exactly like <code>git reset --hard [branch] file</code> (if <code>reset</code> would let you run that)&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;it&#8217;s not working-directory safe, and it does not move HEAD.</p>

<p >Also, like <code>git reset</code> and <code>git add</code>, <code>checkout</code> will accept a <code>--patch</code> option to allow you to selectively revert file contents on a hunk-by-hunk basis.</p>

</section>

</section>

<section class="section" id="_summary_8">
  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p >Hopefully now you understand and feel more comfortable with the <code>reset</code> command, but are probably still a little confused about how exactly it differs from <code>checkout</code> and could not possibly remember all the rules of the different invocations.</p>

<p >Here&#8217;s a cheat-sheet for which commands affect which trees.
The <code>HEAD'' column reads </code>REF'' if that command moves the reference (branch) that HEAD points to, and ``HEAD'' if it moves HEAD itself.
Pay especial attention to the 'WD Safe?' column&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;if it says <strong>NO</strong>, take a second to think before running that command.</p>

Since Git makes it easy to merge another branch multiple times, it means that you can have a very long lived branch but you can keep it up to date as you go, solving small conflicts often, rather than be surprised by one enormous conflict at the end of the series.</p>

<p >However, sometimes tricky conflicts do occur.
Unlike some other version control systems, Git does not try to be overly clever about merge conflict resolution.
Git&#8217;s philosophy is to be smart about determining when a merge resolution is unambiguous, but if there is a conflict, it does not try to be clever about automatically resolving it.
Therefore, if you wait too long to merge two branches that diverge quickly, you can run into some issues.</p>

<p >In this section, we&#8217;ll go over what some of those issues might be and what tools Git gives you to help handle these more tricky situations.
We&#8217;ll also cover some of the different, non-standard types of merges you can do, as well as see how to back out of merges that you&#8217;ve done.</p>

<section class="section" id="_merge_conflicts">
  <h3>Merge Conflicts</h3>
  <p >While we covered some basics on resolving merge conflicts in <a class="xref" href="ch03-git-branching.html#_basic_merge_conflicts">Basic Merge Conflicts</a>, for more complex conflicts, Git provides a few tools to help you figure out what&#8217;s going on and how to better deal with the conflict.</p>

<p >First of all, if at all possible, try to make sure your working directory is clean before doing a merge that may have conflicts.
If you have work in progress, either commit it to a temporary branch or stash it.
This makes it so that you can undo <strong>anything</strong> you try here.
If you have unsaved changes in your working directory when you try a merge, some of these tips may help you preserve that work.</p>

<p >Let&#8217;s walk through a very simple example.
We have a super simple Ruby file that prints 'hello world'.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>#! /usr/bin/env ruby

def hello
  puts 'hello world'
end

hello()</pre>
</figure>

<p >In our repository, we create a new branch named <code>whitespace</code> and proceed to change all the Unix line endings to DOS line endings, essentially changing every line of the file, but just with whitespace.
Then we change the line <code>hello world'' to </code>hello mundo''.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git checkout -b whitespace

<p >Now we try to merge in our <code>whitespace</code> branch and we&#8217;ll get conflicts because of the whitespace changes.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git merge whitespace

</figure>

<section class="section" id="_abort_merge">
  <h4>Aborting a Merge</h4>
  <p >We now have a few options.
First, let&#8217;s cover how to get out of this situation.
If you perhaps weren&#8217;t expecting conflicts and don&#8217;t want to quite deal with the situation yet, you can simply back out of the merge with <code>git merge --abort</code>.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git status -sb
## master
UU hello.rb

$ git merge --abort

$ git status -sb
## master</pre>
</figure>

<p >The <code>git merge --abort</code> option tries to revert back to your state before you ran the merge.
The only cases where it may not be able to do this perfectly would be if you had unstashed, uncommitted changes in your working directory when you ran it, otherwise it should work fine.</p>

<p >If for some reason you just want to start over, you can also run <code>git reset --hard HEAD</code>, and your repository will be back to the last committed state.
Remember that any uncommitted work will be lost, so make sure you don&#8217;t want any of your changes.</p>

</section>

<section class="section" id="_ignoring_whitespace">
  <h4>Ignoring Whitespace</h4>
  <p >In this specific case, the conflicts are whitespace related.
We know this because the case is simple, but it&#8217;s also pretty easy to tell in real cases when looking at the conflict because every line is removed on one side and added again on the other.
By default, Git sees all of these lines as being changed, so it can&#8217;t merge the files.</p>

<p >The default merge strategy can take arguments though, and a few of them are about properly ignoring whitespace changes.
If you see that you have a lot of whitespace issues in a merge, you can simply abort it and do it again, this time with <code>-Xignore-all-space</code> or <code>-Xignore-space-change</code>.
The first option ignores whitespace <strong>completely</strong> when comparing lines, the second treats sequences of one or more whitespace characters as equivalent.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git merge -Xignore-space-change whitespace
Auto-merging hello.rb
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
 hello.rb | 2 +-
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)</pre>
</figure>

<p >Since in this case, the actual file changes were not conflicting, once we ignore the whitespace changes, everything merges just fine.</p>

<p >This is a lifesaver if you have someone on your team who likes to occasionally reformat everything from spaces to tabs or vice-versa.</p>

</section>

<section class="section" id="_manual_remerge">
  <h4>Manual File Re-merging</h4>
  <p >Though Git handles whitespace pre-processing pretty well, there are other types of changes that perhaps Git can&#8217;t handle automatically, but are scriptable fixes.
As an example, let&#8217;s pretend that Git could not handle the whitespace change and we needed to do it by hand.</p>

<p >What we really need to do is run the file we&#8217;re trying to merge in through a <code>dos2unix</code> program before trying the actual file merge.
So how would we do that?</p>

<p >First, we get into the merge conflict state.
Then we want to get copies of my version of the file, their version (from the branch we&#8217;re merging in) and the common version (from where both sides branched off).
Then we want to fix up either their side or our side and re-try the merge again for just this single file.</p>

<p >Getting the three file versions is actually pretty easy.
Git stores all of these versions in the index under <code>stages'' which each have numbers associated with them.
Stage 1 is the common ancestor, stage 2 is your version and stage 3 is from the <code>MERGE_HEAD</code>, the version you&#8217;re merging in (</code>theirs'').</p>

<p >You can extract a copy of each of these versions of the conflicted file with the <code>git show</code> command and a special syntax.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git show :1:hello.rb &gt; hello.common.rb
$ git show :2:hello.rb &gt; hello.ours.rb
$ git show :3:hello.rb &gt; hello.theirs.rb</pre>
</figure>

<p >If you want to get a little more hard core, you can also use the <code>ls-files -u</code> plumbing command to get the actual SHA-1s of the Git blobs for each of these files.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git ls-files -u
100755 ac51efdc3df4f4fd328d1a02ad05331d8e2c9111 1	hello.rb
100755 36c06c8752c78d2aff89571132f3bf7841a7b5c3 2	hello.rb
100755 e85207e04dfdd5eb0a1e9febbc67fd837c44a1cd 3	hello.rb</pre>
</figure>

<p >The <code>:1:hello.rb</code> is just a shorthand for looking up that blob SHA-1.</p>

<p >Now that we have the content of all three stages in our working directory, we can manually fix up theirs to fix the whitespace issue and re-merge the file with the little-known <code>git merge-file</code> command which does just that.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ dos2unix hello.theirs.rb
dos2unix: converting file hello.theirs.rb to Unix format ...

$ git merge-file -p \
    hello.ours.rb hello.common.rb hello.theirs.rb &gt; hello.rb

  #! /usr/bin/env ruby

 +# prints out a greeting
  def hello
-   puts 'hello world'
+   puts 'hello mundo'
  end

  hello()</pre>
</figure>

<p >At this point we have nicely merged the file.
In fact, this actually works better than the <code>ignore-space-change</code> option because this actually fixes the whitespace changes before merge instead of simply ignoring them.
In the <code>ignore-space-change</code> merge, we actually ended up with a few lines with DOS line endings, making things mixed.</p>

<p >If you want to get an idea before finalizing this commit about what was actually changed between one side or the other, you can ask <code>git diff</code> to compare what is in your working directory that you&#8217;re about to commit as the result of the merge to any of these stages.
Let&#8217;s go through them all.</p>

<p >To compare your result to what you had in your branch before the merge, in other words, to see what the merge introduced, you can run <code>git diff --ours</code></p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git diff --ours

<p >So here we can easily see that what happened in our branch, what we&#8217;re actually introducing to this file with this merge, is changing that single line.</p>

<p >If we want to see how the result of the merge differed from what was on their side, you can run <code>git diff --theirs</code>.
In this and the following example, we have to use <code>-b</code> to strip out the whitespace because we&#8217;re comparing it to what is in Git, not our cleaned up <code>hello.theirs.rb</code> file.</p>

  <h4>Checking Out Conflicts</h4>
  <p >Perhaps we&#8217;re not happy with the resolution at this point for some reason, or maybe manually editing one or both sides still didn&#8217;t work well and we need more context.</p>

<p >Let&#8217;s change up the example a little.
For this example, we have two longer lived branches that each have a few commits in them but create a legitimate content conflict when merged.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git log --graph --oneline --decorate --all
* f1270f7 (HEAD, master) update README
* 9af9d3b add a README
* 694971d update phrase to hola world
| * e3eb223 (mundo) add more tests
| * 7cff591 add testing script
| * c3ffff1 changed text to hello mundo
|/
* b7dcc89 initial hello world code</pre>
</figure>

<p >We now have three unique commits that live only on the <code>master</code> branch and three others that live on the <code>mundo</code> branch.
If we try to merge the <code>mundo</code> branch in, we get a conflict.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git merge mundo
Auto-merging hello.rb
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in hello.rb
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.</pre>
</figure>

<p >We would like to see what the merge conflict is.
If we open up the file, we&#8217;ll see something like this:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>#! /usr/bin/env ruby

def hello
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
  puts 'hola world'
=======
  puts 'hello mundo'
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mundo
end

hello()</pre>
</figure>

<p >Both sides of the merge added content to this file, but some of the commits modified the file in the same place that caused this conflict.</p>

<p >Let&#8217;s explore a couple of tools that you now have at your disposal to determine how this conflict came to be.
Perhaps it&#8217;s not obvious how exactly you should fix this conflict.
You need more context.</p>

<p >One helpful tool is <code>git checkout</code> with the <code>--conflict</code> option.
This will re-checkout the file again and replace the merge conflict markers.
This can be useful if you want to reset the markers and try to resolve them again.</p>

<p >You can pass <code>--conflict</code> either <code>diff3</code> or <code>merge</code> (which is the default).
If you pass it <code>diff3</code>, Git will use a slightly different version of conflict markers, not only giving you the <code>ours'' and </code>theirs'' versions, but also the ``base'' version inline to give you more context.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git checkout --conflict=diff3 hello.rb</pre>
</figure>

<p >Once we run that, the file will look like this instead:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>#! /usr/bin/env ruby

def hello
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; ours
  puts 'hola world'
||||||| base
  puts 'hello world'
=======
  puts 'hello mundo'
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; theirs
end

hello()</pre>
</figure>

<p >If you like this format, you can set it as the default for future merge conflicts by setting the <code>merge.conflictstyle</code> setting to <code>diff3</code>.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3</pre>
</figure>

<p >The <code>git checkout</code> command can also take <code>--ours</code> and <code>--theirs</code> options, which can be a really fast way of just choosing either one side or the other without merging things at all.</p>

<p >This can be particularly useful for conflicts of binary files where you can simply choose one side, or where you only want to merge certain files in from another branch&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;you can do the merge and then checkout certain files from one side or the other before committing.</p>

</section>

<section class="section" id="_merge_log">
  <h4>Merge Log</h4>
  <p >Another useful tool when resolving merge conflicts is <code>git log</code>.
This can help you get context on what may have contributed to the conflicts.
Reviewing a little bit of history to remember why two lines of development were touching the same area of code can be really helpful sometimes.</p>

<p >To get a full list of all of the unique commits that were included in either branch involved in this merge, we can use the ``triple dot'' syntax that we learned in <a class="xref" href="ch07-git-tools.html#_triple_dot">Triple Dot</a>.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git log --oneline --left-right HEAD...MERGE_HEAD
&lt; f1270f7 update README
&lt; 9af9d3b add a README
&lt; 694971d update phrase to hola world
&gt; e3eb223 add more tests
&gt; 7cff591 add testing script
&gt; c3ffff1 changed text to hello mundo</pre>
</figure>

<p >That&#8217;s a nice list of the six total commits involved, as well as which line of development each commit was on.</p>

<p >We can further simplify this though to give us much more specific context.
If we add the <code>--merge</code> option to <code>git log</code>, it will only show the commits in either side of the merge that touch a file that&#8217;s currently conflicted.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git log --oneline --left-right --merge
&lt; 694971d update phrase to hola world
&gt; c3ffff1 changed text to hello mundo</pre>
</figure>

<p >If you run that with the <code>-p</code> option instead, you get just the diffs to the file that ended up in conflict.
This can be <strong>really</strong> helpful in quickly giving you the context you need to help understand why something conflicts and how to more intelligently resolve it.</p>

</section>

<section class="section" id="_combined_diff_format">
  <h4>Combined Diff Format</h4>
  <p >Since Git stages any merge results that are successful, when you run <code>git diff</code> while in a conflicted merge state, you only get what is currently still in conflict.
This can be helpful to see what you still have to resolve.</p>

<p >When you run <code>git diff</code> directly after a merge conflict, it will give you information in a rather unique diff output format.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git diff
diff --cc hello.rb
index 0399cd5,59727f0..0000000

 +  puts 'hola world'
++=======
+   puts 'hello mundo'
++&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mundo
  end

  hello()</pre>
</figure>

<p >The format is called <code>Combined Diff'' and gives you two columns of data next to each line.
The first column shows you if that line is different (added or removed) between the </code>ours'' branch and the file in your working directory and the second column does the same between the ``theirs'' branch and your working directory copy.</p>

<p >So in that example you can see that the <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> lines are in the working copy but were not in either side of the merge.
This makes sense because the merge tool stuck them in there for our context, but we&#8217;re expected to remove them.</p>

<p >If we resolve the conflict and run <code>git diff</code> again, we&#8217;ll see the same thing, but it&#8217;s a little more useful.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ vim hello.rb

  def hello
-   puts 'hola world'

  hello()</pre>
</figure>

<p >This shows us that <code>hola world'' was in our side but not in the working copy, that </code>hello mundo'' was in their side but not in the working copy and finally that ``hola mundo'' was not in either side but is now in the working copy.
This can be useful to review before committing the resolution.</p>

<p >You can also get this from the <code>git log</code> for any merge to see how something was resolved after the fact.
Git will output this format if you run <code>git show</code> on a merge commit, or if you add a <code>--cc</code> option to a <code>git log -p</code> (which by default only shows patches for non-merge commits).</p>

<section class="section" id="_undoing_merges">
  <h3>Undoing Merges</h3>
  <p >Now that you know how to create a merge commit, you&#8217;ll probably make some by mistake.
One of the great things about working with Git is that it&#8217;s okay to make mistakes, because it&#8217;s possible (and in many cases easy) to fix them.</p>

<p >Merge commits are no different.
Let&#8217;s say you started work on a topic branch, accidentally merged it into <code>master</code>, and now your commit history looks like this:</p>

<figure class="image" >
  
    <img src="images/undomerge-start.png"
         alt="Accidental merge commit."
         
          />
  
  
    <figcaption>Figure 138. Accidental merge commit</figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p >There are two ways to approach this problem, depending on what your desired outcome is.</p>

<section class="section" id="_fix_the_references">
  <h4>Fix the references</h4>
  <p >If the unwanted merge commit only exists on your local repository, the easiest and best solution is to move the branches so that they point where you want them to.
In most cases, if you follow the errant <code>git merge</code> with <code>git reset --hard HEAD~</code>, this will reset the branch pointers so they look like this:</p>

<figure class="image" >
  
    <img src="images/undomerge-reset.png"
         alt="History after `git reset --hard HEAD~`."
         
          />
  
  
    <figcaption>Figure 139. History after <code>git reset --hard HEAD~</code></figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p >We covered <code>reset</code> back in <a class="xref" href="ch07-git-tools.html#_git_reset">Reset Demystified</a>, so it shouldn&#8217;t be too hard to figure out what&#8217;s going on here.
Here&#8217;s a quick refresher: <code>reset --hard</code> usually goes through three steps:</p>

<ol class="olist" >
  
    <li>
      <p>Move the branch HEAD points to.
In this case, we want to move <code>master</code> to where it was before the merge commit (<code>C6</code>).</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Make the index look like HEAD.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Make the working directory look like the index.</p>
      
    </li>
  
</ol>

<p >The downside of this approach is that it&#8217;s rewriting history, which can be problematic with a shared repository.
Check out <a class="xref" href="ch03-git-branching.html#_rebase_peril">The Perils of Rebasing</a> for more on what can happen; the short version is that if other people have the commits you&#8217;re rewriting, you should probably avoid <code>reset</code>.
This approach also won&#8217;t work if any other commits have been created since the merge; moving the refs would effectively lose those changes.</p>

</section>

<section class="section" id="_reverse_commit">
  <h4>Reverse the commit</h4>
  <p >If moving the branch pointers around isn&#8217;t going to work for you, Git gives you the option of making a new commit which undoes all the changes from an existing one.
Git calls this operation a ``revert'', and in this particular scenario, you&#8217;d invoke it like this:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git revert -m 1 HEAD
[master b1d8379] Revert "Merge branch 'topic'"</pre>
</figure>

<p >The <code>-m 1</code> flag indicates which parent is the <code>`mainline'' and should be kept.
When you invoke a merge into `HEAD</code> (<code>git merge topic</code>), the new commit has two parents: the first one is <code>HEAD</code> (<code>C6</code>), and the second is the tip of the branch being merged in (<code>C4</code>).
In this case, we want to undo all the changes introduced by merging in parent #2 (<code>C4</code>), while keeping all the content from parent #1 (<code>C6</code>).</p>

<p >The history with the revert commit looks like this:</p>

<figure class="image" >
  
    <img src="images/undomerge-revert.png"
         alt="History after `git revert -m 1`."
         
          />
  
  
    <figcaption>Figure 140. History after <code>git revert -m 1</code></figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p >The new commit <code>^M</code> has exactly the same contents as <code>C6</code>, so starting from here it&#8217;s as if the merge never happened, except that the now-unmerged commits are still in <code>HEAD&#8217;s history.
Git will get confused if you try to merge `topic</code> into <code>master</code> again:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git merge topic

</figure>

<p >There&#8217;s nothing in <code>topic</code> that isn&#8217;t already reachable from <code>master</code>.
What&#8217;s worse, if you add work to <code>topic</code> and merge again, Git will only bring in the changes <em>since</em> the reverted merge:</p>

<figure class="image" >
  
    <img src="images/undomerge-revert2.png"
         alt="History with a bad merge."
         
          />
  
  
    <figcaption>Figure 141. History with a bad merge</figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p >The best way around this is to un-revert the original merge, since now you want to bring in the changes that were reverted out, <strong>then</strong> create a new merge commit:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git revert ^M
[master 09f0126] Revert "Revert "Merge branch 'topic'""
$ git merge topic</pre>
</figure>

<figure class="image" >
  
    <img src="images/undomerge-revert3.png"
         alt="History after re-merging a reverted merge."
         
          />
  
  
    <figcaption>Figure 142. History after re-merging a reverted merge</figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p >In this example, <code>M</code> and <code>^M</code> cancel out.
<code>^^M</code> effectively merges in the changes from <code>C3</code> and <code>C4</code>, and <code>C8</code> merges in the changes from <code>C7</code>, so now <code>topic</code> is fully merged.</p>

  <h3>Other Types of Merges</h3>
  <p >So far we&#8217;ve covered the normal merge of two branches, normally handled with what is called the ``recursive'' strategy of merging.
There are other ways to merge branches together however.
Let&#8217;s cover a few of them quickly.</p>

<section class="section" id="_our_or_theirs_preference">
  <h4>Our or Theirs Preference</h4>
  <p >First of all, there is another useful thing we can do with the normal <code>`recursive'' mode of merging.
We&#8217;ve already seen the `ignore-all-space</code> and <code>ignore-space-change</code> options which are passed with a <code>-X</code> but we can also tell Git to favor one side or the other when it sees a conflict.</p>

<p >By default, when Git sees a conflict between two branches being merged, it will add merge conflict markers into your code and mark the file as conflicted and let you resolve it.
If you would prefer for Git to simply choose a specific side and ignore the other side instead of letting you manually resolve the conflict, you can pass the <code>merge</code> command either a <code>-Xours</code> or <code>-Xtheirs</code>.</p>

<p >If Git sees this, it will not add conflict markers.
Any differences that are mergeable, it will merge.
Any differences that conflict, it will simply choose the side you specify in whole, including binary files.</p>

<p >If we go back to the ``hello world'' example we were using before, we can see that merging in our branch causes conflicts.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git merge mundo
Auto-merging hello.rb
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in hello.rb
Resolved 'hello.rb' using previous resolution.
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.</pre>
</figure>

<p >However if we run it with <code>-Xours</code> or <code>-Xtheirs</code> it does not.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git merge -Xours mundo
Auto-merging hello.rb
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
 hello.rb | 2 +-
 test.sh  | 2 ++
 2 files changed, 3 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
 create mode 100644 test.sh</pre>
</figure>

<p >In that case, instead of getting conflict markers in the file with <code>hello mundo'' on one side and </code>hola world'' on the other, it will simply pick ``hola world''.
However, all the other non-conflicting changes on that branch are merged successfully in.</p>

<p >This option can also be passed to the <code>git merge-file</code> command we saw earlier by running something like <code>git merge-file --ours</code> for individual file merges.</p>

<p >If you want to do something like this but not have Git even try to merge changes from the other side in, there is a more draconian option, which is the <code>ours'' merge <em>strategy</em>.
This is different from the </code>ours'' recursive merge <em>option</em>.</p>

<p >This will basically do a fake merge.
It will record a new merge commit with both branches as parents, but it will not even look at the branch you&#8217;re merging in.
It will simply record as the result of the merge the exact code in your current branch.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git merge -s ours mundo
Merge made by the 'ours' strategy.
$ git diff HEAD HEAD~
$</pre>
</figure>

<p >You can see that there is no difference between the branch we were on and the result of the merge.</p>

<p >This can often be useful to basically trick Git into thinking that a branch is already merged when doing a merge later on.
For example, say you branched off a <code>release</code> branch and have done some work on it that you will want to merge back into your <code>master</code> branch at some point.
In the meantime some bugfix on <code>master</code> needs to be backported into your <code>release</code> branch.
You can merge the bugfix branch into the <code>release</code> branch and also <code>merge -s ours</code> the same branch into your <code>master</code> branch (even though the fix is already there) so when you later merge the <code>release</code> branch again, there are no conflicts from the bugfix.</p>

</section>

<section class="section" id="_subtree_merge">
  <h4>Subtree Merging</h4>
  <p >The idea of the subtree merge is that you have two projects, and one of the projects maps to a subdirectory of the other one.
When you specify a subtree merge, Git is often smart enough to figure out that one is a subtree of the other and merge appropriately.</p>

<p >We&#8217;ll go through an example of adding a separate project into an existing project and then merging the code of the second into a subdirectory of the first.</p>

<p >First, we&#8217;ll add the Rack application to our project.
We&#8217;ll add the Rack project as a remote reference in our own project and then check it out into its own branch:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git remote add rack_remote https://github.com/rack/rack
$ git fetch rack_remote --no-tags
warning: no common commits
remote: Counting objects: 3184, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (1465/1465), done.
remote: Total 3184 (delta 1952), reused 2770 (delta 1675)
Receiving objects: 100% (3184/3184), 677.42 KiB | 4 KiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (1952/1952), done.
From https://github.com/rack/rack
 * [new branch]      build      -&gt; rack_remote/build
 * [new branch]      master     -&gt; rack_remote/master
 * [new branch]      rack-0.4   -&gt; rack_remote/rack-0.4
 * [new branch]      rack-0.9   -&gt; rack_remote/rack-0.9
$ git checkout -b rack_branch rack_remote/master
Branch rack_branch set up to track remote branch refs/remotes/rack_remote/master.
Switched to a new branch "rack_branch"</pre>
</figure>

<p >Now we have the root of the Rack project in our <code>rack_branch</code> branch and our own project in the <code>master</code> branch.
If you check out one and then the other, you can see that they have different project roots:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ ls
AUTHORS         KNOWN-ISSUES   Rakefile      contrib         lib
COPYING         README         bin           example         test
$ git checkout master
Switched to branch "master"
$ ls
README</pre>
</figure>

<p >This is sort of a strange concept.
Not all the branches in your repository actually have to be branches of the same project.
It&#8217;s not common, because it&#8217;s rarely helpful, but it&#8217;s fairly easy to have branches contain completely different histories.</p>

<p >In this case, we want to pull the Rack project into our <code>master</code> project as a subdirectory.
We can do that in Git with <code>git read-tree</code>.
You&#8217;ll learn more about <code>read-tree</code> and its friends in <a class="xref" href="ch10-git-internals.html">Git Internals</a>, but for now know that it reads the root tree of one branch into your current staging area and working directory.
We just switched back to your <code>master</code> branch, and we pull the <code>rack_branch</code> branch into the <code>rack</code> subdirectory of our <code>master</code> branch of our main project:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git read-tree --prefix=rack/ -u rack_branch</pre>
</figure>

<p >When we commit, it looks like we have all the Rack files under that subdirectory – as though we copied them in from a tarball.
What gets interesting is that we can fairly easily merge changes from one of the branches to the other.
So, if the Rack project updates, we can pull in upstream changes by switching to that branch and pulling:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git checkout rack_branch
$ git pull</pre>
</figure>

<p >Then, we can merge those changes back into our <code>master</code> branch.
To pull in the changes and prepopulate the commit message, use the <code>--squash</code> option, as well as the recursive merge strategy&#8217;s <code>-Xsubtree</code> option.
(The recursive strategy is the default here, but we include it for clarity.)</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git checkout master
$ git merge --squash -s recursive -Xsubtree=rack rack_branch
Squash commit -- not updating HEAD
Automatic merge went well; stopped before committing as requested</pre>
</figure>

<p >All the changes from the Rack project are merged in and ready to be committed locally.
You can also do the opposite – make changes in the <code>rack</code> subdirectory of your <code>master</code> branch and then merge them into your <code>rack_branch</code> branch later to submit them to the maintainers or push them upstream.</p>

<p >This gives us a way to have a workflow somewhat similar to the submodule workflow without using submodules (which we will cover in <a class="xref" href="ch07-git-tools.html#_git_submodules">Submodules</a>).
We can keep branches with other related projects in our repository and subtree merge them into our project occasionally.
It is nice in some ways, for example all the code is committed to a single place.
However, it has other drawbacks in that it&#8217;s a bit more complex and easier to make mistakes in reintegrating changes or accidentally pushing a branch into an unrelated repository.</p>

<p >Another slightly weird thing is that to get a diff between what you have in your <code>rack</code> subdirectory and the code in your <code>rack_branch</code> branch – to see if you need to merge them – you can&#8217;t use the normal <code>diff</code> command.
Instead, you must run <code>git diff-tree</code> with the branch you want to compare to:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git diff-tree -p rack_branch</pre>
</figure>

<p >Or, to compare what is in your <code>rack</code> subdirectory with what the <code>master</code> branch on the server was the last time you fetched, you can run</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git diff-tree -p rack_remote/master</pre>
</figure>

<section class="section" id="ref_rerere">
  <h2>Rerere</h2>
  <p >The <code>git rerere</code> functionality is a bit of a hidden feature.
The name stands for ``reuse recorded resolution'' and, as the name implies, it allows you to ask Git to remember how you&#8217;ve resolved a hunk conflict so that the next time it sees the same conflict, Git can resolve it for you automatically.</p>

<p >There are a number of scenarios in which this functionality might be really handy.
One of the examples that is mentioned in the documentation is when you want to make sure a long-lived topic branch will ultimately merge cleanly, but you don&#8217;t want to have a bunch of intermediate merge commits cluttering up your commit history.
With <code>rerere</code> enabled, you can attempt the occasional merge, resolve the conflicts, then back out of the merge.
If you do this continuously, then the final merge should be easy because <code>rerere</code> can just do everything for you automatically.</p>

<p >This same tactic can be used if you want to keep a branch rebased so you don&#8217;t have to deal with the same rebasing conflicts each time you do it.
Or if you want to take a branch that you merged and fixed a bunch of conflicts and then decide to rebase it instead&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;you likely won&#8217;t have to do all the same conflicts again.</p>

<p >Another application of <code>rerere</code> is where you merge a bunch of evolving topic branches together into a testable head occasionally, as the Git project itself often does.
If the tests fail, you can rewind the merges and re-do them without the topic branch that made the tests fail without having to re-resolve the conflicts again.</p>

<p >To enable <code>rerere</code> functionality, you simply have to run this config setting:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git config --global rerere.enabled true</pre>
</figure>

<p >You can also turn it on by creating the <code>.git/rr-cache</code> directory in a specific repository, but the config setting is clearer and enables that feature globally for you.</p>

<p >Now let&#8217;s see a simple example, similar to our previous one.
Let&#8217;s say we have a file named <code>hello.rb</code> that looks like this:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>#! /usr/bin/env ruby

def hello
  puts 'hello world'
end</pre>
</figure>

<p >In one branch we change the word <code>hello'' to </code>hola'', then in another branch we change the <code>world'' to </code>mundo'', just like before.</p>

<figure class="image" >
  
    <img src="images/rerere1.png"
         alt="rerere1"
         
          />
  
  
</figure>

<p >When we merge the two branches together, we&#8217;ll get a merge conflict:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git merge i18n-world
Auto-merging hello.rb
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in hello.rb
Recorded preimage for 'hello.rb'
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.</pre>
</figure>

<p >You should notice the new line <code>Recorded preimage for FILE</code> in there.
Otherwise it should look exactly like a normal merge conflict.
At this point, <code>rerere</code> can tell us a few things.
Normally, you might run <code>git status</code> at this point to see what all conflicted:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git status
# On branch master
# Unmerged paths:
#   (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
#   (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to mark resolution)
#
#	both modified:      hello.rb
#</pre>
</figure>

<p >However, <code>git rerere</code> will also tell you what it has recorded the pre-merge state for with <code>git rerere status</code>:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git rerere status
hello.rb</pre>
</figure>

<p >And <code>git rerere diff</code> will show the current state of the resolution&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;what you started with to resolve and what you&#8217;ve resolved it to.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git rerere diff

</figure>

<p >Also (and this isn&#8217;t really related to <code>rerere</code>), you can use <code>git ls-files -u</code> to see the conflicted files and the before, left and right versions:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git ls-files -u

<p >So that basically says, when Git sees a hunk conflict in a <code>hello.rb</code> file that has <code>hello mundo'' on one side and </code>hola world'' on the other, it will resolve it to ``hola mundo''.</p>

<p >Now we can mark it as resolved and commit it:</p>

          />
  
  
</figure>

<p >Now, let&#8217;s undo that merge and then rebase it on top of our <code>master</code> branch instead.
We can move our branch back by using <code>git reset</code> as we saw in <a class="xref" href="ch07-git-tools.html#_git_reset">Reset Demystified</a>.</p>

  <pre>$ git reset --hard HEAD^

<p >Our merge is undone.
Now let&#8217;s rebase the topic branch.</p>

$ git rebase master

<p >Now, we got the same merge conflict like we expected, but take a look at the <code>Resolved FILE using previous resolution</code> line.
If we look at the file, we&#8217;ll see that it&#8217;s already been resolved, there are no merge conflict markers in it.</p>

<figure class="listing" >

<p >Also, <code>git diff</code> will show you how it was automatically re-resolved:</p>

<p >You can also recreate the conflicted file state with <code>git checkout</code>:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git checkout --conflict=merge hello.rb

</figure>

<p >We saw an example of this in <a class="xref" href="ch07-git-tools.html#_advanced_merging">Advanced Merging</a>.
For now though, let&#8217;s re-resolve it by just running <code>git rerere</code> again:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git rerere
Resolved 'hello.rb' using previous resolution.
$ cat hello.rb

<p >We have re-resolved the file automatically using the <code>rerere</code> cached resolution.

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git add hello.rb
$ git rebase --continue
Applying: i18n one word</pre>
</figure>

<p >So, if you do a lot of re-merges, or want to keep a topic branch up to date with your <code>master</code> branch without a ton of merges, or you rebase often, you can turn on <code>rerere</code> to help your life out a bit.</p>

<section class="section" id="_debugging_with_git">
  <h2>Debugging with Git</h2>
  <p >In addition to being primarily for version control, Git also provides a couple commands to help you debug your source code projects.
Because Git is designed to handle nearly any type of content, these tools are pretty generic, but they can often help you hunt for a bug or culprit when things go wrong.</p>

<section class="section" id="_file_annotation">
  <h3>File Annotation</h3>
  <p >If you track down a bug in your code and want to know when it was introduced and why, file annotation is often your best tool.
It shows you what commit was the last to modify each line of any file.
So if you see that a method in your code is buggy, you can annotate the file with <code>git blame</code> to determine which commit was responsible for the introduction of that line.</p>

<p >The following example uses <code>git blame</code> to determine which commit and committer was responsible for lines in the top-level Linux kernel <code>Makefile</code> and, further, uses the <code>-L</code> option to restrict the output of the annotation to lines 69 through 82 of that file:</p>

<p >Notice that the first field is the partial SHA-1 of the commit that last modified that line.
The next two fields are values extracted from that commit&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the author name and the authored date of that commit&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;so you can easily see who modified that line and when.
After that come the line number and the content of the file.
Also note the <code>^1da177e4c3f4</code> commit lines, where the <code>^</code> prefix designates lines that were introduced in the repository&#8217;s initial commit and have remained unchanged ever since.
This is a tad confusing, because now you&#8217;ve seen at least three different ways that Git uses the <code>^</code> to modify a commit SHA-1, but that is what it means here.</p>

<p >Another cool thing about Git is that it doesn&#8217;t track file renames explicitly.
It records the snapshots and then tries to figure out what was renamed implicitly, after the fact.
One of the interesting features of this is that you can ask it to figure out all sorts of code movement as well.
If you pass <code>-C</code> to <code>git blame</code>, Git analyzes the file you&#8217;re annotating and tries to figure out where snippets of code within it originally came from if they were copied from elsewhere.
For example, say you are refactoring a file named <code>GITServerHandler.m</code> into multiple files, one of which is <code>GITPackUpload.m</code>.
By blaming <code>GITPackUpload.m</code> with the <code>-C</code> option, you can see where sections of the code originally came from:</p>

<p >This is really useful.
Normally, you get as the original commit the commit where you copied the code over, because that is the first time you touched those lines in this file.
Git tells you the original commit where you wrote those lines, even if it was in another file.</p>

</section>

<section class="section" id="_binary_search">
  <h3>Binary Search</h3>
  <p >Annotating a file helps if you know where the issue is to begin with.
If you don&#8217;t know what is breaking, and there have been dozens or hundreds of commits since the last state where you know the code worked, you&#8217;ll likely turn to <code>git bisect</code> for help.
The <code>bisect</code> command does a binary search through your commit history to help you identify as quickly as possible which commit introduced an issue.</p>

<p >Let&#8217;s say you just pushed out a release of your code to a production environment, you&#8217;re getting bug reports about something that wasn&#8217;t happening in your development environment, and you can&#8217;t imagine why the code is doing that.
You go back to your code, and it turns out you can reproduce the issue, but you can&#8217;t figure out what is going wrong.
You can <em>bisect</em> the code to find out.
First you run <code>git bisect start</code> to get things going, and then you use <code>git bisect bad</code> to tell the system that the current commit you&#8217;re on is broken.
Then, you must tell bisect when the last known good state was, using <code>git bisect good &lt;good_commit&gt;</code>:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git bisect start
$ git bisect bad
$ git bisect good v1.0
Bisecting: 6 revisions left to test after this
[ecb6e1bc347ccecc5f9350d878ce677feb13d3b2] error handling on repo</pre>
</figure>

<p >Git figured out that about 12 commits came between the commit you marked as the last good commit (v1.0) and the current bad version, and it checked out the middle one for you.
At this point, you can run your test to see if the issue exists as of this commit.
If it does, then it was introduced sometime before this middle commit; if it doesn&#8217;t, then the problem was introduced sometime after the middle commit.
It turns out there is no issue here, and you tell Git that by typing <code>git bisect good</code> and continue your journey:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git bisect good
Bisecting: 3 revisions left to test after this
[b047b02ea83310a70fd603dc8cd7a6cd13d15c04] secure this thing</pre>
</figure>

<p >Now you&#8217;re on another commit, halfway between the one you just tested and your bad commit.
You run your test again and find that this commit is broken, so you tell Git that with <code>git bisect bad</code>:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git bisect bad
Bisecting: 1 revisions left to test after this
[f71ce38690acf49c1f3c9bea38e09d82a5ce6014] drop exceptions table</pre>
</figure>

<p >This commit is fine, and now Git has all the information it needs to determine where the issue was introduced.
It tells you the SHA-1 of the first bad commit and show some of the commit information and which files were modified in that commit so you can figure out what happened that may have introduced this bug:</p>

<figure class="listing" >

</figure>

<p >When you&#8217;re finished, you should run <code>git bisect reset</code> to reset your HEAD to where you were before you started, or you&#8217;ll end up in a weird state:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git bisect reset</pre>
</figure>

<p >This is a powerful tool that can help you check hundreds of commits for an introduced bug in minutes.
In fact, if you have a script that will exit 0 if the project is good or non-0 if the project is bad, you can fully automate <code>git bisect</code>.
First, you again tell it the scope of the bisect by providing the known bad and good commits.
You can do this by listing them with the <code>bisect start</code> command if you want, listing the known bad commit first and the known good commit second:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git bisect start HEAD v1.0
$ git bisect run test-error.sh</pre>
</figure>

<p >Doing so automatically runs <code>test-error.sh</code> on each checked-out commit until Git finds the first broken commit.
You can also run something like <code>make</code> or <code>make tests</code> or whatever you have that runs automated tests for you.</p>

<section class="section" id="_git_submodules">
  <h2>Submodules</h2>
  <p >It often happens that while working on one project, you need to use another project from within it.
Perhaps it&#8217;s a library that a third party developed or that you&#8217;re developing separately and using in multiple parent projects.
A common issue arises in these scenarios: you want to be able to treat the two projects as separate yet still be able to use one from within the other.</p>

<p >Here&#8217;s an example.
Suppose you&#8217;re developing a website and creating Atom feeds.
Instead of writing your own Atom-generating code, you decide to use a library.
You&#8217;re likely to have to either include this code from a shared library like a CPAN install or Ruby gem, or copy the source code into your own project tree.
The issue with including the library is that it&#8217;s difficult to customize the library in any way and often more difficult to deploy it, because you need to make sure every client has that library available.
The issue with copying the code into your own project is that any custom changes you make are difficult to merge when upstream changes become available.</p>

<p >Git addresses this issue using submodules.
Submodules allow you to keep a Git repository as a subdirectory of another Git repository.
This lets you clone another repository into your project and keep your commits separate.</p>

<section class="section" id="_starting_submodules">
  <h3>Starting with Submodules</h3>
  <p >We&#8217;ll walk through developing a simple project that has been split up into a main project and a few sub-projects.</p>

<p >Let&#8217;s start by adding an existing Git repository as a submodule of the repository that we&#8217;re working on.
To add a new submodule you use the <code>git submodule add</code> command with the absolute or relative URL of the project you would like to start tracking.
In this example, we&#8217;ll add a library called ``DbConnector''.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git submodule add https://github.com/chaconinc/DbConnector
Cloning into 'DbConnector'...
remote: Counting objects: 11, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (10/10), done.
remote: Total 11 (delta 0), reused 11 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (11/11), done.
Checking connectivity... done.</pre>
</figure>

<p >By default, submodules will add the subproject into a directory named the same as the repository, in this case ``DbConnector''.
You can add a different path at the end of the command if you want it to go elsewhere.</p>

<p >If you run <code>git status</code> at this point, you&#8217;ll notice a few things.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

	new file:   .gitmodules
	new file:   DbConnector</pre>
</figure>

<p >First you should notice the new <code>.gitmodules</code> file.
This is a configuration file that stores the mapping between the project&#8217;s URL and the local subdirectory you&#8217;ve pulled it into:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>[submodule "DbConnector"]
	path = DbConnector
	url = https://github.com/chaconinc/DbConnector</pre>
</figure>

<p >If you have multiple submodules, you&#8217;ll have multiple entries in this file.
It&#8217;s important to note that this file is version-controlled with your other files, like your <code>.gitignore</code> file.
It&#8217;s pushed and pulled with the rest of your project.
This is how other people who clone this project know where to get the submodule projects from.</p>

<div class="admonition admonition-note" >
  <div class="admonition-icon">
  </div>
  <div class="admonition-content">
    
    <p >Since the URL in the .gitmodules file is what other people will first try to clone/fetch from, make sure to use a URL that they can access if possible.
For example, if you use a different URL to push to than others would to pull from, use the one that others have access to.
You can overwrite this value locally with <code>git config submodule.DbConnector.url PRIVATE_URL</code> for your own use.
When applicable, a relative URL can be helpful.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p >The other listing in the <code>git status</code> output is the project folder entry.
If you run <code>git diff</code> on that, you see something interesting:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git diff --cached DbConnector
diff --git a/DbConnector b/DbConnector
new file mode 160000
index 0000000..c3f01dc

@@ -0,0 +1 @@
+Subproject commit c3f01dc8862123d317dd46284b05b6892c7b29bc</pre>
</figure>

<p >Although <code>DbConnector</code> is a subdirectory in your working directory, Git sees it as a submodule and doesn&#8217;t track its contents when you&#8217;re not in that directory.
Instead, Git sees it as a particular commit from that repository.</p>

<p >If you want a little nicer diff output, you can pass the <code>--submodule</code> option to <code>git diff</code>.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git diff --cached --submodule

</figure>

<p >When you commit, you see something like this:</p>

<figure class="listing" >

</figure>

<p >Notice the <code>160000</code> mode for the <code>DbConnector</code> entry.
That is a special mode in Git that basically means you&#8217;re recording a commit as a directory entry rather than a subdirectory or a file.</p>

<p >Lastly, push these changes:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git push origin master</pre>

  <h3>Cloning a Project with Submodules</h3>
  <p >Here we&#8217;ll clone a project with a submodule in it.
When you clone such a project, by default you get the directories that contain submodules, but none of the files within them yet:</p>

$ cd DbConnector/
$ ls
$</pre>
</figure>

<p >The <code>DbConnector</code> directory is there, but empty.
You must run two commands: <code>git submodule init</code> to initialize your local configuration file, and <code>git submodule update</code> to fetch all the data from that project and check out the appropriate commit listed in your superproject:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git submodule init
Submodule 'DbConnector' (https://github.com/chaconinc/DbConnector) registered for path 'DbConnector'
$ git submodule update

Submodule path 'DbConnector': checked out 'c3f01dc8862123d317dd46284b05b6892c7b29bc'</pre>
</figure>

<p >Now your <code>DbConnector</code> subdirectory is at the exact state it was in when you committed earlier.</p>

<p >There is another way to do this which is a little simpler, however.
If you pass <code>--recurse-submodules</code> to the <code>git clone</code> command, it will automatically initialize and update each submodule in the repository, including nested submodules if any of the submodules in the repository have submodules themselves.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/chaconinc/MainProject

remote: Counting objects: 14, done.

</figure>

<p >If you already cloned the project and forgot <code>--recurse-submodules</code>, you can combine the <code>git submodule init</code> and <code>git submodule update</code> steps by running <code>git submodule update --init</code>.
To also initialize, fetch and checkout any nested submodules, you can use the foolproof <code>git submodule update --init --recursive</code>.</p>

<section class="section" id="_working_on_a_project_with_submodules">
  <h3>Working on a Project with Submodules</h3>
  <p >Now we have a copy of a project with submodules in it and will collaborate with our teammates on both the main project and the submodule project.</p>

<section class="section" id="_pulling_in_upstream_changes_from_the_submodule_remote">
  <h4>Pulling in Upstream Changes from the Submodule Remote</h4>
  <p >The simplest model of using submodules in a project would be if you were simply consuming a subproject and wanted to get updates from it from time to time but were not actually modifying anything in your checkout.
Let&#8217;s walk through a simple example there.</p>

<p >If you want to check for new work in a submodule, you can go into the directory and run <code>git fetch</code> and <code>git merge</code> the upstream branch to update the local code.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git fetch
From https://github.com/chaconinc/DbConnector
   c3f01dc..d0354fc  master     -&gt; origin/master
$ git merge origin/master
Updating c3f01dc..d0354fc
Fast-forward
 scripts/connect.sh | 1 +
 src/db.c           | 1 +
 2 files changed, 2 insertions(+)</pre>
</figure>

<p >Now if you go back into the main project and run <code>git diff --submodule</code> you can see that the submodule was updated and get a list of commits that were added to it.
If you don&#8217;t want to type <code>--submodule</code> every time you run <code>git diff</code>, you can set it as the default format by setting the <code>diff.submodule</code> config value to ``log''.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git config --global diff.submodule log
$ git diff
Submodule DbConnector c3f01dc..d0354fc:
  &gt; more efficient db routine
  &gt; better connection routine</pre>
</figure>

<p >If you commit at this point then you will lock the submodule into having the new code when other people update.</p>

<p >There is an easier way to do this as well, if you prefer to not manually fetch and merge in the subdirectory.
If you run <code>git submodule update --remote</code>, Git will go into your submodules and fetch and update for you.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git submodule update --remote DbConnector
remote: Counting objects: 4, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 4 (delta 2), reused 4 (delta 2)
Unpacking objects: 100% (4/4), done.
From https://github.com/chaconinc/DbConnector

Submodule path 'DbConnector': checked out 'd0354fc054692d3906c85c3af05ddce39a1c0644'</pre>
</figure>

<p >This command will by default assume that you want to update the checkout to the <code>master</code> branch of the submodule repository.
You can, however, set this to something different if you want.
For example, if you want to have the DbConnector submodule track that repository&#8217;s <code>`stable'' branch, you can set it in either your `.gitmodules</code> file (so everyone else also tracks it), or just in your local <code>.git/config</code> file.
Let&#8217;s set it in the <code>.gitmodules</code> file:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git config -f .gitmodules submodule.DbConnector.branch stable

$ git submodule update --remote
remote: Counting objects: 4, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 4 (delta 2), reused 4 (delta 2)
Unpacking objects: 100% (4/4), done.
From https://github.com/chaconinc/DbConnector
   27cf5d3..c87d55d  stable -&gt; origin/stable
Submodule path 'DbConnector': checked out 'c87d55d4c6d4b05ee34fbc8cb6f7bf4585ae6687'</pre>
</figure>

<p >If you leave off the <code>-f .gitmodules</code> it will only make the change for you, but it probably makes more sense to track that information with the repository so everyone else does as well.</p>

<p >When we run <code>git status</code> at this point, Git will show us that we have ``new commits'' on the submodule.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)

  modified:   .gitmodules
  modified:   DbConnector (new commits)

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")</pre>
</figure>

<p >If you set the configuration setting <code>status.submodulesummary</code>, Git will also show you a short summary of changes to your submodules:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git config status.submodulesummary 1

$ git status

Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.

	modified:   DbConnector (new commits)

Submodules changed but not updated:

* DbConnector c3f01dc...c87d55d (4):
  &gt; catch non-null terminated lines</pre>
</figure>

<p >At this point if you run <code>git diff</code> we can see both that we have modified our <code>.gitmodules</code> file and also that there are a number of commits that we&#8217;ve pulled down and are ready to commit to our submodule project.</p>

This is shown by the output of the <code>git status</code> command, which shows the submodule is <code>modified'', and has </code>new commits''.
What&#8217;s more, the brackets showing the new commits point left (&lt;), indicating that these commits are recorded in MainProject but are not present in the local DbConnector checkout.
To finalize the update, you need to run <code>git submodule update</code>:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git submodule update --init --recursive
Submodule path 'vendor/plugins/demo': checked out '48679c6302815f6c76f1fe30625d795d9e55fc56'

$ git status
 On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
nothing to commit, working tree clean</pre>
</figure>

<p >Note that to be on the safe side, you should run <code>git submodule update</code> with the <code>--init</code> flag in case the MainProject commits you just pulled added new submodules, and with the <code>--recursive</code> flag if any submodules have nested submodules.</p>

<p >If you want to automate this process, you can add the <code>--recurse-submodules</code> flag to the <code>git pull</code> command (since Git 2.14).
This will make Git run <code>git submodule update</code> right after the pull, putting the submodules in the correct state.
Moreover, if you want to make Git always pull with <code>--recurse-submodules</code>, you can set the configuration option <code>submodule.recurse</code> to true (this works for <code>git pull</code> since Git 2.15).
This option will make Git use the <code>--recurse-submodules</code> flag for all commands that support it (except <code>clone</code>).</p>

<p >There is a special situation that can happen when pulling superproject updates: it could be that the upstream repository has changed the URL of the submodule in the <code>.gitmodules</code> file in one of the commits you pull.
This can happen for example if the submodule project changes its hosting platform.
In that case, it is possible for <code>git pull --recurse-submodules</code>, or <code>git submodule update</code>, to fail if the superproject references a submodule commit that is not found in the submodule remote locally configured in your repository.
In order to remedy this situation, the <code>git submodule sync</code> command is required:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre># copy the new URL to your local config
$ git submodule sync --recursive
# update the submodule from the new URL
$ git submodule update --init --recursive</pre>

  <h4>Working on a Submodule</h4>
  <p >It&#8217;s quite likely that if you&#8217;re using submodules, you&#8217;re doing so because you really want to work on the code in the submodule at the same time as you&#8217;re working on the code in the main project (or across several submodules).
Otherwise you would probably instead be using a simpler dependency management system (such as Maven or Rubygems).</p>

<p >So now let&#8217;s go through an example of making changes to the submodule at the same time as the main project and committing and publishing those changes at the same time.</p>

<p >So far, when we&#8217;ve run the <code>git submodule update</code> command to fetch changes from the submodule repositories, Git would get the changes and update the files in the subdirectory but will leave the sub-repository in what&#8217;s called a <code>`detached HEAD'' state.
This means that there is no local working branch (like `master</code>, for example) tracking changes.
With no working branch tracking changes, that means even if you commit changes to the submodule, those changes will quite possibly be lost the next time you run <code>git submodule update</code>.
You have to do some extra steps if you want changes in a submodule to be tracked.</p>

<p >In order to set up your submodule to be easier to go in and hack on, you need to do two things.
You need to go into each submodule and check out a branch to work on.
Then you need to tell Git what to do if you have made changes and then <code>git submodule update --remote</code> pulls in new work from upstream.
The options are that you can merge them into your local work, or you can try to rebase your local work on top of the new changes.</p>

<p >First of all, let&#8217;s go into our submodule directory and check out a branch.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ cd DbConnector/
$ git checkout stable
Switched to branch 'stable'</pre>
</figure>

<p >Let&#8217;s try updating our submodule with the <code>`merge'' option.
To specify it manually, we can just add the `--merge</code> option to our <code>update</code> call.
Here we&#8217;ll see that there was a change on the server for this submodule and it gets merged in.</p>

  <h4>Publishing Submodule Changes</h4>
  <p >Now we have some changes in our submodule directory.
Some of these were brought in from upstream by our updates and others were made locally and aren&#8217;t available to anyone else yet as we haven&#8217;t pushed them yet.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git diff

</figure>

<p >If we commit in the main project and push it up without pushing the submodule changes up as well, other people who try to check out our changes are going to be in trouble since they will have no way to get the submodule changes that are depended on.
Those changes will only exist on our local copy.</p>

<p >In order to make sure this doesn&#8217;t happen, you can ask Git to check that all your submodules have been pushed properly before pushing the main project.
The <code>git push</code> command takes the <code>--recurse-submodules</code> argument which can be set to either <code>check'' or </code>on-demand''.
The <code>`check'' option will make `push</code> simply fail if any of the committed submodule changes haven&#8217;t been pushed.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git push --recurse-submodules=check
The following submodule paths contain changes that can
not be found on any remote:
  DbConnector

Please try

	git push --recurse-submodules=on-demand

or cd to the path and use

	git push

to push them to a remote.</pre>
</figure>

<p >As you can see, it also gives us some helpful advice on what we might want to do next.
The simple option is to go into each submodule and manually push to the remotes to make sure they&#8217;re externally available and then try this push again.
If you want the check behavior to happen for all pushes, you can make this behavior the default by doing <code>git config push.recurseSubmodules check</code>.</p>

<p >The other option is to use the ``on-demand'' value, which will try to do this for you.</p>

<figure class="listing" >

  <h4>Merging Submodule Changes</h4>
  <p >If you change a submodule reference at the same time as someone else, you may run into some problems.
That is, if the submodule histories have diverged and are committed to diverging branches in a superproject, it may take a bit of work for you to fix.</p>

<p >If one of the commits is a direct ancestor of the other (a fast-forward merge), then Git will simply choose the latter for the merge, so that works fine.</p>

<p >Git will not attempt even a trivial merge for you, however.
If the submodule commits diverge and need to be merged, you will get something that looks like this:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git pull
remote: Counting objects: 2, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (1/1), done.

Fetching submodule DbConnector
warning: Failed to merge submodule DbConnector (merge following commits not found)
Auto-merging DbConnector
CONFLICT (submodule): Merge conflict in DbConnector
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.</pre>
</figure>

<p >So basically what has happened here is that Git has figured out that the two branches record points in the submodule&#8217;s history that are divergent and need to be merged.
It explains it as ``merge following commits not found'', which is confusing but we&#8217;ll explain why that is in a bit.</p>

<p >To solve the problem, you need to figure out what state the submodule should be in.
Strangely, Git doesn&#8217;t really give you much information to help out here, not even the SHA-1s of the commits of both sides of the history.
Fortunately, it&#8217;s simple to figure out.
If you run <code>git diff</code> you can get the SHA-1s of the commits recorded in both branches you were trying to merge.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git diff
diff --cc DbConnector
index eb41d76,c771610..0000000
--- a/DbConnector
+++ b/DbConnector</pre>
</figure>

<p >So, in this case, <code>eb41d76</code> is the commit in our submodule that <strong>we</strong> had and <code>c771610</code> is the commit that upstream had.
If we go into our submodule directory, it should already be on <code>eb41d76</code> as the merge would not have touched it.
If for whatever reason it&#8217;s not, you can simply create and checkout a branch pointing to it.</p>

<p >What is important is the SHA-1 of the commit from the other side.
This is what you&#8217;ll have to merge in and resolve.
You can either just try the merge with the SHA-1 directly, or you can create a branch for it and then try to merge that in.
We would suggest the latter, even if only to make a nicer merge commit message.</p>

<p >So, we will go into our submodule directory, create a branch based on that second SHA-1 from <code>git diff</code> and manually merge.</p>

</ul>

<p >It can be a bit confusing, but it&#8217;s really not very hard.</p>

<p >Interestingly, there is another case that Git handles.
If a merge commit exists in the submodule directory that contains <strong>both</strong> commits in its history, Git will suggest it to you as a possible solution.
It sees that at some point in the submodule project, someone merged branches containing these two commits, so maybe you&#8217;ll want that one.</p>

<p >This is why the error message from before was ``merge following commits not found'', because it could not do <strong>this</strong>.
It&#8217;s confusing because who would expect it to <strong>try</strong> to do this?</p>

<p >If it does find a single acceptable merge commit, you&#8217;ll see something like this:</p>

<figure class="listing" >

  <p >For instance, switching branches with submodules in them can also be tricky with Git versions older than Git 2.13.
If you create a new branch, add a submodule there, and then switch back to a branch without that submodule, you still have the submodule directory as an untracked directory:</p>

<p >Using the <code>--recurse-submodules</code> flag of <code>git checkout</code> can also be useful when you work on several branches in the superproject, each having your submodule pointing at different commits.
Indeed, if you switch between branches that record the submodule at different commits, upon executing <code>git status</code> the submodule will appear as <code>modified'', and indicate </code>new commits''. That is because the submodule state is by default not carried over when switching branches.</p>

<p >This can be really confusing, so it&#8217;s a good idea to always <code>git checkout --recurse-submodules</code> when your project has submodules.
(For older Git versions that do not have the  <code>--recurse-submodules</code> flag, after the checkout you can use <code>git submodule update --init --recursive</code> to put the submodules in the right state.)</p>

<p >Luckily, you can tell Git (&gt;=2.14) to always use the  <code>--recurse-submodules</code> flag by setting the configuration option <code>submodule.recurse</code>: <code>git config submodule.recurse true</code>.
As noted above, this will also make Git recurse into submodules for every command that has a <code>--recurse-submodules</code> option (except <code>git clone</code>).</p>

  <h4>Switching from subdirectories to submodules</h4>
  <p >The other main caveat that many people run into involves switching from subdirectories to submodules.
If you&#8217;ve been tracking files in your project and you want to move them out into a submodule, you must be careful or Git will get angry at you.
Assume that you have files in a subdirectory of your project, and you want to switch it to a submodule.
If you delete the subdirectory and then run <code>submodule add</code>, Git yells at you:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ rm -Rf CryptoLibrary/
$ git submodule add https://github.com/chaconinc/CryptoLibrary
'CryptoLibrary' already exists in the index</pre>
</figure>

<p >You have to unstage the <code>CryptoLibrary</code> directory first.
Then you can add the submodule:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git rm -r CryptoLibrary
$ git submodule add https://github.com/chaconinc/CryptoLibrary
Cloning into 'CryptoLibrary'...
remote: Counting objects: 11, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (10/10), done.
remote: Total 11 (delta 0), reused 11 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (11/11), done.
Checking connectivity... done.</pre>
</figure>

<p >Now suppose you did that in a branch.
If you try to switch back to a branch where those files are still in the actual tree rather than a submodule – you get this error:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git checkout master
error: The following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by checkout:
  CryptoLibrary/Makefile
  CryptoLibrary/includes/crypto.h
  ...
Please move or remove them before you can switch branches.
Aborting</pre>
</figure>

<p >You can force it to switch with <code>checkout -f</code>, but be careful that you don&#8217;t have unsaved changes in there as they could be overwritten with that command.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git checkout -f master
warning: unable to rmdir CryptoLibrary: Directory not empty
Switched to branch 'master'</pre>
</figure>

<p >Then, when you switch back, you get an empty <code>CryptoLibrary</code> directory for some reason and <code>git submodule update</code> may not fix it either.
You may need to go into your submodule directory and run a <code>git checkout .</code> to get all your files back.
You could run this in a <code>submodule foreach</code> script to run it for multiple submodules.</p>

<p >It&#8217;s important to note that submodules these days keep all their Git data in the top project&#8217;s <code>.git</code> directory, so unlike much older versions of Git, destroying a submodule directory won&#8217;t lose any commits or branches that you had.</p>

<p >With these tools, submodules can be a fairly simple and effective method for developing on several related but still separate projects simultaneously.</p>

  <h2>Bundling</h2>
  <p >Though we&#8217;ve covered the common ways to transfer Git data over a network (HTTP, SSH, etc), there is actually one more way to do so that is not commonly used but can actually be quite useful.</p>

<p >Git is capable of <code>`bundling'' its data into a single file.
This can be useful in various scenarios.
Maybe your network is down and you want to send changes to your co-workers.
Perhaps you&#8217;re working somewhere offsite and don&#8217;t have access to the local network for security reasons.
Maybe your wireless/ethernet card just broke.
Maybe you don&#8217;t have access to a shared server for the moment, you want to email someone updates and you don&#8217;t want to transfer 40 commits via `format-patch</code>.</p>

<p >This is where the <code>git bundle</code> command can be helpful.
The <code>bundle</code> command will package up everything that would normally be pushed over the wire with a <code>git push</code> command into a binary file that you can email to someone or put on a flash drive, then unbundle into another repository.</p>

<p >Let&#8217;s see a simple example.
Let&#8217;s say you have a repository with two commits:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git log
commit 9a466c572fe88b195efd356c3f2bbeccdb504102
Author: Scott Chacon &lt;schacon@gmail.com&gt;
Date:   Wed Mar 10 07:34:10 2010 -0800

    second commit

commit b1ec3248f39900d2a406049d762aa68e9641be25
Author: Scott Chacon &lt;schacon@gmail.com&gt;
Date:   Wed Mar 10 07:34:01 2010 -0800

    first commit</pre>
</figure>

<p >If you want to send that repository to someone and you don&#8217;t have access to a repository to push to, or simply don&#8217;t want to set one up, you can bundle it with <code>git bundle create</code>.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git bundle create repo.bundle HEAD master
Counting objects: 6, done.
Delta compression using up to 2 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
Writing objects: 100% (6/6), 441 bytes, done.
Total 6 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)</pre>
</figure>

<p >Now you have a file named <code>repo.bundle</code> that has all the data needed to re-create the repository&#8217;s <code>master</code> branch.
With the <code>bundle</code> command you need to list out every reference or specific range of commits that you want to be included.
If you intend for this to be cloned somewhere else, you should add HEAD as a reference as well as we&#8217;ve done here.</p>

<p >You can email this <code>repo.bundle</code> file to someone else, or put it on a USB drive and walk it over.</p>

<p >On the other side, say you are sent this <code>repo.bundle</code> file and want to work on the project.
You can clone from the binary file into a directory, much like you would from a URL.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git clone repo.bundle repo
Cloning into 'repo'...
...
$ cd repo
$ git log --oneline
9a466c5 second commit
b1ec324 first commit</pre>
</figure>

<p >If you don&#8217;t include HEAD in the references, you have to also specify <code>-b master</code> or whatever branch is included because otherwise it won&#8217;t know what branch to check out.</p>

<p >Now let&#8217;s say you do three commits on it and want to send the new commits back via a bundle on a USB stick or email.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git log --oneline
71b84da last commit - second repo
c99cf5b fourth commit - second repo
7011d3d third commit - second repo
9a466c5 second commit
b1ec324 first commit</pre>
</figure>

<p >First we need to determine the range of commits we want to include in the bundle.
Unlike the network protocols which figure out the minimum set of data to transfer over the network for us, we&#8217;ll have to figure this out manually.
 Now, you could just do the same thing and bundle the entire repository, which will work, but it&#8217;s better to just bundle up the difference - just the three commits we just made locally.</p>

<p >In order to do that, you&#8217;ll have to calculate the difference.
As we described in <a class="xref" href="ch07-git-tools.html#_commit_ranges">Commit Ranges</a>, you can specify a range of commits in a number of ways.
To get the three commits that we have in our <code>master</code> branch that weren&#8217;t in the branch we originally cloned, we can use something like <code>origin/master..master</code> or <code>master ^origin/master</code>.
You can test that with the <code>log</code> command.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git log --oneline master ^origin/master
71b84da last commit - second repo
c99cf5b fourth commit - second repo
7011d3d third commit - second repo</pre>
</figure>

<p >So now that we have the list of commits we want to include in the bundle, let&#8217;s bundle them up.
We do that with the <code>git bundle create</code> command, giving it a filename we want our bundle to be and the range of commits we want to go into it.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git bundle create commits.bundle master ^9a466c5
Counting objects: 11, done.
Delta compression using up to 2 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (9/9), 775 bytes, done.
Total 9 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)</pre>
</figure>

<p >Now we have a <code>commits.bundle</code> file in our directory.
If we take that and send it to our partner, she can then import it into the original repository, even if more work has been done there in the meantime.</p>

<p >When she gets the bundle, she can inspect it to see what it contains before she imports it into her repository.
The first command is the <code>bundle verify</code> command that will make sure the file is actually a valid Git bundle and that you have all the necessary ancestors to reconstitute it properly.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git bundle verify ../commits.bundle
The bundle contains 1 ref
71b84daaf49abed142a373b6e5c59a22dc6560dc refs/heads/master
The bundle requires these 1 ref
9a466c572fe88b195efd356c3f2bbeccdb504102 second commit
../commits.bundle is okay</pre>
</figure>

<p >If the bundler had created a bundle of just the last two commits they had done, rather than all three, the original repository would not be able to import it, since it is missing requisite history.
The <code>verify</code> command would have looked like this instead:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git bundle verify ../commits-bad.bundle
error: Repository lacks these prerequisite commits:
error: 7011d3d8fc200abe0ad561c011c3852a4b7bbe95 third commit - second repo</pre>
</figure>

<p >However, our first bundle is valid, so we can fetch in commits from it.
If you want to see what branches are in the bundle that can be imported, there is also a command to just list the heads:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git bundle list-heads ../commits.bundle
71b84daaf49abed142a373b6e5c59a22dc6560dc refs/heads/master</pre>
</figure>

<p >The <code>verify</code> sub-command will tell you the heads as well.
The point is to see what can be pulled in, so you can use the <code>fetch</code> or <code>pull</code> commands to import commits from this bundle.
Here we&#8217;ll fetch the <code>master</code> branch of the bundle to a branch named <code>other-master</code> in our repository:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git fetch ../commits.bundle master:other-master
From ../commits.bundle
 * [new branch]      master     -&gt; other-master</pre>
</figure>

<p >Now we can see that we have the imported commits on the <code>other-master</code> branch as well as any commits we&#8217;ve done in the meantime in our own <code>master</code> branch.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all
* 8255d41 (HEAD, master) third commit - first repo
| * 71b84da (other-master) last commit - second repo
| * c99cf5b fourth commit - second repo
| * 7011d3d third commit - second repo
|/
* 9a466c5 second commit
* b1ec324 first commit</pre>
</figure>

<p >So, <code>git bundle</code> can be really useful for sharing or doing network-type operations when you don&#8217;t have the proper network or shared repository to do so.</p>

<section class="section" id="_replace">
  <h2>Replace</h2>
  <p >As we&#8217;ve emphasized before, the objects in Git&#8217;s object database are unchangeable, but Git does provide an interesting way to <em>pretend</em> to replace objects in its database with other objects.</p>

<p >The <code>replace</code> command lets you specify an object in Git and say "every time you refer to <em>this</em> object, pretend it&#8217;s a <em>different</em> object".
This is most commonly useful for replacing one commit in your history with another one without having to rebuild the entire history with, say, <code>git filter-branch</code>.</p>

<p >For example, let&#8217;s say you have a huge code history and want to split your repository into one short history for new developers and one much longer and larger history for people interested in data mining.
You can graft one history onto the other by "replacing" the earliest commit in the new line with the latest commit on the older one.
This is nice because it means that you don&#8217;t actually have to rewrite every commit in the new history, as you would normally have to do to join them together (because the parentage affects the SHA-1s).</p>

<p >Let&#8217;s try this out.
Let&#8217;s take an existing repository, split it into two repositories, one recent and one historical, and then we&#8217;ll see how we can recombine them without modifying the recent repositories SHA-1 values via <code>replace</code>.</p>

<p >We&#8217;ll use a simple repository with five simple commits:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git log --oneline
ef989d8 fifth commit
c6e1e95 fourth commit
9c68fdc third commit
945704c second commit
c1822cf first commit</pre>
</figure>

<p >We want to break this up into two lines of history.
One line goes from commit one to commit four - that will be the historical one.
The second line will just be commits four and five - that will be the recent history.</p>

<figure class="image" >
  
    <img src="images/replace1.png"
         alt="replace1"
         
          />
  
  
</figure>

<p >Well, creating the historical history is easy, we can just put a branch in the history and then push that branch to the <code>master</code> branch of a new remote repository.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git branch history c6e1e95
$ git log --oneline --decorate
ef989d8 (HEAD, master) fifth commit
c6e1e95 (history) fourth commit
9c68fdc third commit
945704c second commit
c1822cf first commit</pre>
</figure>

<figure class="image" >
  
    <img src="images/replace2.png"
         alt="replace2"
         
          />
  
  
</figure>

<p >Now we can push the new <code>history</code> branch to the <code>master</code> branch of our new repository:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git remote add project-history https://github.com/schacon/project-history
$ git push project-history history:master
Counting objects: 12, done.
Delta compression using up to 2 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.
Writing objects: 100% (12/12), 907 bytes, done.
Total 12 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (12/12), done.
To git@github.com:schacon/project-history.git
 * [new branch]      history -&gt; master</pre>
</figure>

<p >OK, so our history is published.
Now the harder part is truncating our recent history down so it&#8217;s smaller.
We need an overlap so we can replace a commit in one with an equivalent commit in the other, so we&#8217;re going to truncate this to just commits four and five (so commit four overlaps).</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git log --oneline --decorate
ef989d8 (HEAD, master) fifth commit
c6e1e95 (history) fourth commit
9c68fdc third commit
945704c second commit
c1822cf first commit</pre>
</figure>

<p >It&#8217;s useful in this case to create a base commit that has instructions on how to expand the history, so other developers know what to do if they hit the first commit in the truncated history and need more.
So, what we&#8217;re going to do is create an initial commit object as our base point with instructions, then rebase the remaining commits (four and five) on top of it.</p>

<p >To do that, we need to choose a point to split at, which for us is the third commit, which is <code>9c68fdc</code> in SHA-speak.
So, our base commit will be based off of that tree.
We can create our base commit using the <code>commit-tree</code> command, which just takes a tree and will give us a brand new, parentless commit object SHA-1 back.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ echo 'get history from blah blah blah' | git commit-tree 9c68fdc^{tree}
622e88e9cbfbacfb75b5279245b9fb38dfea10cf</pre>

<div class="admonition admonition-note" >
  <div class="admonition-icon">

  <div class="admonition-content">
    
    <p >The <code>commit-tree</code> command is one of a set of commands that are commonly referred to as 'plumbing' commands.
These are commands that are not generally meant to be used directly, but instead are used by <strong>other</strong> Git commands to do smaller jobs.
On occasions when we&#8217;re doing weirder things like this, they allow us to do really low-level things but are not meant for daily use.
You can read more about plumbing commands in <a class="xref" href="ch10-git-internals.html#_plumbing_porcelain">Plumbing and Porcelain</a></p>

    <img src="images/replace3.png"
         alt="replace3"
         
          />
  
  
</figure>

<p >OK, so now that we have a base commit, we can rebase the rest of our history on top of that with <code>git rebase --onto</code>.
The <code>--onto</code> argument will be the SHA-1 we just got back from <code>commit-tree</code> and the rebase point will be the third commit (the parent of the first commit we want to keep, <code>9c68fdc</code>):</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git rebase --onto 622e88 9c68fdc
First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
Applying: fourth commit
Applying: fifth commit</pre>

<figure class="image" >
  
    <img src="images/replace4.png"
         alt="replace4"
         
          />
  
  
</figure>

<p >OK, so now we&#8217;ve re-written our recent history on top of a throw away base commit that now has instructions in it on how to reconstitute the entire history if we wanted to.
We can push that new history to a new project and now when people clone that repository, they will only see the most recent two commits and then a base commit with instructions.</p>

<p >Let&#8217;s now switch roles to someone cloning the project for the first time who wants the entire history.
To get the history data after cloning this truncated repository, one would have to add a second remote for the historical repository and fetch:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git clone https://github.com/schacon/project
$ cd project

$ git log --oneline master
e146b5f fifth commit
81a708d fourth commit
622e88e get history from blah blah blah

$ git remote add project-history https://github.com/schacon/project-history
$ git fetch project-history
From https://github.com/schacon/project-history
 * [new branch]      master     -&gt; project-history/master</pre>
</figure>

<p >Now the collaborator would have their recent commits in the <code>master</code> branch and the historical commits in the <code>project-history/master</code> branch.</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git log --oneline master
e146b5f fifth commit
81a708d fourth commit
622e88e get history from blah blah blah

$ git log --oneline project-history/master
c6e1e95 fourth commit
9c68fdc third commit
945704c second commit
c1822cf first commit</pre>
</figure>

<p >To combine them, you can simply call <code>git replace</code> with the commit you want to replace and then the commit you want to replace it with.
So we want to replace the "fourth" commit in the <code>master</code> branch with the "fourth" commit in the <code>project-history/master</code> branch:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git replace 81a708d c6e1e95</pre>
</figure>

<p >Now, if you look at the history of the <code>master</code> branch, it appears to look like this:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git log --oneline master
e146b5f fifth commit
81a708d fourth commit
9c68fdc third commit
945704c second commit
c1822cf first commit</pre>
</figure>

<p >Cool, right?  Without having to change all the SHA-1s upstream, we were able to replace one commit in our history with an entirely different commit and all the normal tools (<code>bisect</code>, <code>blame</code>, etc) will work how we would expect them to.</p>

<figure class="image" >
  
    <img src="images/replace5.png"
         alt="replace5"
         
          />
  
  
</figure>

<p >Interestingly, it still shows <code>81a708d</code> as the SHA-1, even though it&#8217;s actually using the <code>c6e1e95</code> commit data that we replaced it with.
Even if you run a command like <code>cat-file</code>, it will show you the replaced data:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git cat-file -p 81a708d
tree 7bc544cf438903b65ca9104a1e30345eee6c083d
parent 9c68fdceee073230f19ebb8b5e7fc71b479c0252
author Scott Chacon &lt;schacon@gmail.com&gt; 1268712581 -0700
committer Scott Chacon &lt;schacon@gmail.com&gt; 1268712581 -0700

fourth commit</pre>
</figure>

<p >Remember that the actual parent of <code>81a708d</code> was our placeholder commit (<code>622e88e</code>), not <code>9c68fdce</code> as it states here.</p>

<p >Another interesting thing is that this data is kept in our references:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git for-each-ref
e146b5f14e79d4935160c0e83fb9ebe526b8da0d commit	refs/heads/master
c6e1e95051d41771a649f3145423f8809d1a74d4 commit	refs/remotes/history/master
e146b5f14e79d4935160c0e83fb9ebe526b8da0d commit	refs/remotes/origin/HEAD
e146b5f14e79d4935160c0e83fb9ebe526b8da0d commit	refs/remotes/origin/master

</figure>

<p >This means that it&#8217;s easy to share our replacement with others, because we can push this to our server and other people can easily download it.
This is not that helpful in the history grafting scenario we&#8217;ve gone over here (since everyone would be downloading both histories anyhow, so why separate them?) but it can be useful in other circumstances.</p>

  <h2>Credential Storage</h2>
  <p ><a class="indexterm" id="_indexterm_165">&#8203;</a>
<a class="indexterm" id="_indexterm_166">&#8203;</a>
If you use the SSH transport for connecting to remotes, it&#8217;s possible for you to have a key without a passphrase, which allows you to securely transfer data without typing in your username and password.
However, this isn&#8217;t possible with the HTTP protocols – every connection needs a username and password.
This gets even harder for systems with two-factor authentication, where the token you use for a password is randomly generated and unpronounceable.</p>

<p >Fortunately, Git has a credentials system that can help with this.
Git has a few options provided in the box:</p>

<ul class="ulist" >
  
    <li>
      <p>The default is not to cache at all.
Every connection will prompt you for your username and password.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>The ``cache'' mode keeps credentials in memory for a certain period of time.
None of the passwords are ever stored on disk, and they are purged from the cache after 15 minutes.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>The ``store'' mode saves the credentials to a plain-text file on disk, and they never expire.
This means that until you change your password for the Git host, you won&#8217;t ever have to type in your credentials again.
The downside of this approach is that your passwords are stored in cleartext in a plain file in your home directory.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>If you&#8217;re using a Mac, Git comes with an ``osxkeychain'' mode, which caches credentials in the secure keychain that&#8217;s attached to your system account.
This method stores the credentials on disk, and they never expire, but they&#8217;re encrypted with the same system that stores HTTPS certificates and Safari auto-fills.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>If you&#8217;re using Windows, you can install a helper called <code>Git Credential Manager for Windows.''
This is similar to the </code>osxkeychain'' helper described above, but uses the Windows Credential Store to control sensitive information.
It can be found at <a class="link" href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows"
     
      >https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows</a>.</p>
      
    </li>
  
</ul>

<p >You can choose one of these methods by setting a Git configuration value:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git config --global credential.helper cache</pre>
</figure>

<p >Some of these helpers have options.
The <code>store'' helper can take a <code>--file &lt;path&gt;</code> argument, which customizes where the plain-text file is saved (the default is <code>~/.git-credentials</code>).
The </code>cache'' helper accepts the <code>--timeout &lt;seconds&gt;</code> option, which changes the amount of time its daemon is kept running (the default is <code>900'', or 15 minutes).
Here&#8217;s an example of how you&#8217;d configure the </code>store'' helper with a custom file name:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git config --global credential.helper 'store --file ~/.my-credentials'</pre>
</figure>

<p >Git even allows you to configure several helpers.
When looking for credentials for a particular host, Git will query them in order, and stop after the first answer is provided.
When saving credentials, Git will send the username and password to <strong>all</strong> of the helpers in the list, and they can choose what to do with them.
Here&#8217;s what a <code>.gitconfig</code> would look like if you had a credentials file on a thumb drive, but wanted to use the in-memory cache to save some typing if the drive isn&#8217;t plugged in:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>[credential]
    helper = store --file /mnt/thumbdrive/.git-credentials
    helper = cache --timeout 30000</pre>
</figure>

<section class="section" id="_under_the_hood">
  <h3>Under the Hood</h3>
  <p >How does this all work?
Git&#8217;s root command for the credential-helper system is <code>git credential</code>, which takes a command as an argument, and then more input through stdin.</p>

<p >This might be easier to understand with an example.
Let&#8217;s say that a credential helper has been configured, and the helper has stored credentials for <code>mygithost</code>.
Here&#8217;s a session that uses the ``fill'' command, which is invoked when Git is trying to find credentials for a host:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git credential fill <a class="callout" id="callout-CO7-1" href="#colist-CO7-1">1</a>
protocol=https <a class="callout" id="callout-CO7-2" href="#colist-CO7-2">2</a>
host=mygithost
<a class="callout" id="callout-CO7-3" href="#colist-CO7-3">3</a>
protocol=https <a class="callout" id="callout-CO7-4" href="#colist-CO7-4">4</a>
host=mygithost
username=bob
password=s3cre7
$ git credential fill <a class="callout" id="callout-CO7-5" href="#colist-CO7-5">5</a>
protocol=https
host=unknownhost

Username for 'https://unknownhost': bob
Password for 'https://bob@unknownhost':
protocol=https
host=unknownhost
username=bob
password=s3cre7</pre>
</figure>

<ul class="colist" >
  
    <li>
      <a class="callout" id="colist-CO7-1" href="#callout-CO7-1">1</a> This is the command line that initiates the interaction.
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <a class="callout" id="colist-CO7-2" href="#callout-CO7-2">2</a> Git-credential is then waiting for input on stdin.
We provide it with the things we know: the protocol and hostname.
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <a class="callout" id="colist-CO7-3" href="#callout-CO7-3">3</a> A blank line indicates that the input is complete, and the credential system should answer with what it knows.
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <a class="callout" id="colist-CO7-4" href="#callout-CO7-4">4</a> Git-credential then takes over, and writes to stdout with the bits of information it found.
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <a class="callout" id="colist-CO7-5" href="#callout-CO7-5">5</a> If credentials are not found, Git asks the user for the username and password, and provides them back to the invoking stdout (here they&#8217;re attached to the same console).
    </li>
  
</ul>

<p >The credential system is actually invoking a program that&#8217;s separate from Git itself; which one and how depends on the <code>credential.helper</code> configuration value.
There are several forms it can take:</p>

<table class="table" >
  
  
    <thead>
      
        <tr>
          
            <th 
                >Configuration Value</th>
          
            <th 
                >Behavior</th>
          
        </tr>
      
    </thead>
  
  
    <tbody>
      
        <tr>
          
            <td 
                ><code>foo</code></td>
          
            <td 
                >Runs <code>git-credential-foo</code></td>
          
        </tr>
      
        <tr>
          
            <td 
                ><code>foo -a --opt=bcd</code></td>
          
            <td 
                >Runs <code>git-credential-foo -a --opt=bcd</code></td>
          
        </tr>
      
        <tr>
          
            <td 
                ><code>/absolute/path/foo -xyz</code></td>
          
            <td 
                >Runs <code>/absolute/path/foo -xyz</code></td>
          
        </tr>
      
        <tr>
          
            <td 
                ><code>!f() { echo "password=s3cre7"; }; f</code></td>
          
            <td 
                >Code after <code>!</code> evaluated in shell</td>
          
        </tr>
      
    </tbody>
  
  
</table>

<p >So the helpers described above are actually named <code>git-credential-cache</code>, <code>git-credential-store</code>, and so on, and we can configure them to take command-line arguments.
The general form for this is ``git-credential-foo [args] &lt;action&gt;.''
The stdin/stdout protocol is the same as git-credential, but they use a slightly different set of actions:</p>

<ul class="ulist" >
  
    <li>
      <p><code>get</code> is a request for a username/password pair.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p><code>store</code> is a request to save a set of credentials in this helper&#8217;s memory.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p><code>erase</code> purge the credentials for the given properties from this helper&#8217;s memory.</p>
      
    </li>
  
</ul>

<p >For the <code>store</code> and <code>erase</code> actions, no response is required (Git ignores it anyway).
For the <code>get</code> action, however, Git is very interested in what the helper has to say.
If the helper doesn&#8217;t know anything useful, it can simply exit with no output, but if it does know, it should augment the provided information with the information it has stored.
The output is treated like a series of assignment statements; anything provided will replace what Git already knows.</p>

<p >Here&#8217;s the same example from above, but skipping git-credential and going straight for git-credential-store:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git credential-store --file ~/git.store store <a class="callout" id="callout-CO8-1" href="#colist-CO8-1">1</a>
protocol=https
host=mygithost
username=bob
password=s3cre7
$ git credential-store --file ~/git.store get <a class="callout" id="callout-CO8-2" href="#colist-CO8-2">2</a>
protocol=https
host=mygithost

username=bob <a class="callout" id="callout-CO8-3" href="#colist-CO8-3">3</a>
password=s3cre7</pre>
</figure>

<ul class="colist" >
  
    <li>
      <a class="callout" id="colist-CO8-1" href="#callout-CO8-1">1</a> Here we tell <code>git-credential-store</code> to save some credentials: the username <code>bob'' and the password </code>s3cre7'' are to be used when <code><a class="link" href="https://mygithost"
     
      >https://mygithost</a></code> is accessed.
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <a class="callout" id="colist-CO8-2" href="#callout-CO8-2">2</a> Now we&#8217;ll retrieve those credentials.
We provide the parts of the connection we already know (<code><a class="link" href="https://mygithost"
     
      >https://mygithost</a></code>), and an empty line.
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <a class="callout" id="colist-CO8-3" href="#callout-CO8-3">3</a> <code>git-credential-store</code> replies with the username and password we stored above.
    </li>
  
</ul>

<p >Here&#8217;s what the <code>~/git.store</code> file looks like:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>https://bob:s3cre7@mygithost</pre>
</figure>

<p >It&#8217;s just a series of lines, each of which contains a credential-decorated URL.
The <code>osxkeychain</code> and <code>wincred</code> helpers use the native format of their backing stores, while <code>cache</code> uses its own in-memory format (which no other process can read).</p>

</section>

<section class="section" id="_a_custom_credential_cache">
  <h3>A Custom Credential Cache</h3>
  <p >Given that <code>git-credential-store</code> and friends are separate programs from Git, it&#8217;s not much of a leap to realize that <em>any</em> program can be a Git credential helper.
The helpers provided by Git cover many common use cases, but not all.
For example, let&#8217;s say your team has some credentials that are shared with the entire team, perhaps for deployment.
These are stored in a shared directory, but you don&#8217;t want to copy them to your own credential store, because they change often.
None of the existing helpers cover this case; let&#8217;s see what it would take to write our own.
There are several key features this program needs to have:</p>

<ol class="olist" >
  
    <li>
      <p>The only action we need to pay attention to is <code>get</code>; <code>store</code> and <code>erase</code> are write operations, so we&#8217;ll just exit cleanly when they&#8217;re received.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>The file format of the shared-credential file is the same as that used by <code>git-credential-store</code>.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>The location of that file is fairly standard, but we should allow the user to pass a custom path just in case.</p>
      
    </li>
  
</ol>

<p >Once again, we&#8217;ll write this extension in Ruby, but any language will work so long as Git can execute the finished product.
Here&#8217;s the full source code of our new credential helper:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require 'optparse'

path = File.expand_path '~/.git-credentials' <a class="callout" id="callout-CO9-1" href="#colist-CO9-1">1</a>
OptionParser.new do |opts|
    opts.banner = 'USAGE: git-credential-read-only [options] &lt;action&gt;'
    opts.on('-f', '--file PATH', 'Specify path for backing store') do |argpath|
        path = File.expand_path argpath
    end
end.parse!

exit(0) unless ARGV[0].downcase == 'get' <a class="callout" id="callout-CO9-2" href="#colist-CO9-2">2</a>
exit(0) unless File.exists? path

known = {} <a class="callout" id="callout-CO9-3" href="#colist-CO9-3">3</a>
while line = STDIN.gets
    break if line.strip == ''
    k,v = line.strip.split '=', 2
    known[k] = v
end

File.readlines(path).each do |fileline| <a class="callout" id="callout-CO9-4" href="#colist-CO9-4">4</a>
    prot,user,pass,host = fileline.scan(/^(.*?):\/\/(.*?):(.*?)@(.*)$/).first
    if prot == known['protocol'] and host == known['host'] and user == known['username'] then
        puts "protocol=#{prot}"
        puts "host=#{host}"
        puts "username=#{user}"
        puts "password=#{pass}"
        exit(0)
    end
end</pre>
</figure>

<ul class="colist" >
  
    <li>
      <a class="callout" id="colist-CO9-1" href="#callout-CO9-1">1</a> Here we parse the command-line options, allowing the user to specify the input file.
The default is <code>~/.git-credentials</code>.
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <a class="callout" id="colist-CO9-2" href="#callout-CO9-2">2</a> This program only responds if the action is <code>get</code> and the backing-store file exists.
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <a class="callout" id="colist-CO9-3" href="#callout-CO9-3">3</a> This loop reads from stdin until the first blank line is reached.
The inputs are stored in the <code>known</code> hash for later reference.
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <a class="callout" id="colist-CO9-4" href="#callout-CO9-4">4</a> This loop reads the contents of the storage file, looking for matches.
If the protocol and host from <code>known</code> match this line, the program prints the results to stdout and exits.
    </li>
  
</ul>

<p >We&#8217;ll save our helper as <code>git-credential-read-only</code>, put it somewhere in our <code>PATH</code> and mark it executable.
Here&#8217;s what an interactive session looks like:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git credential-read-only --file=/mnt/shared/creds get
protocol=https
host=mygithost

protocol=https
host=mygithost
username=bob
password=s3cre7</pre>
</figure>

<p >Since its name starts with ``git-'', we can use the simple syntax for the configuration value:</p>

<figure class="listing" >
  
  <pre>$ git config --global credential.helper 'read-only --file /mnt/shared/creds'</pre>
</figure>

<p >As you can see, extending this system is pretty straightforward, and can solve some common problems for you and your team.</p>
